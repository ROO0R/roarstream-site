   <section class="story">
<i>I've looked through some job magazines, and I found work at a restaurant. It's an Italian restaurant called Platinum.'</i><br>
<br>
<b>Which, if I don't say so myself, is a damn cool name for a
restaurant. 'I had lunch the other day at that restaurant.' 'oh which-'
'MOTHERFUCKING PLATINUM BABY.'</b><br>
<br>
<i>It's close to my house, the work doesn't sound too tough, and they'll pay me good...It's a perfect place to work! I'm going for an interview now.</i><br>
<br>
<b></b>A scene shift later...</b><br>
<br>
<i>"Hah...hah...I thought the restaurant was close to my house...but I can't find it."<br>

I'm lost. I'm sure
I'm close. I thought it was going to take only 15 minutes or so to get
there, but I've been walking for more than half an hour. I've been
wandering around this area for a long time...I may look like a pervert.</i><br>
<br>
<b>This is why we find out where the hell things are before we apply to work for them.</b><br>
<br>
<i>"Usually, restaurants have big signs..." I don't often go out to eat at restaurants, so I don't know what to look for...Hah...Is it a small restaurant?&#822. No - they are offering too much money for just a small restaurant.</i><br>
<br>
<b>That's right. You only make REAL money at big chains, like Olive Garden.</b><br>
<br>
<i>The info I got
from the flier mentioned that it's an Italian restaurant, and they need
someone to help, and how much they'll pay. It might be an underground restaurant where they always have to keep bouncers..."</i><br>
<br>
<b>Yeah, apply good luck applying for THAT job, girlboy.</b><br>
<br>
<i>Well, I don't
think so..."Oh...I'll be late..." I'm glad I left early. But I might be
late, even though I left early...If I'm late for the interview, I'm sure
I won't get the job. I won't be able to find such a good offer
somewhere else!<br>
<br>
I'd better try to find the restaurant...ah..."</i><br>
<br>
<b>JESUS. YOU'RE LATE. WE GET IT. Instead of talking about, why don't you, you know, look around some more?"</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/snap106.jpg" alt="" class="img" border="0"><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">: <i>"What was I looking for..."<br>
<br>
I droop my shoulders...I don't have time to be like this. I look at my watch. I have five minutes before the interview.<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0"> "Good...I made it."<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-v.gif" alt="" border="0"> "You made what?"<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0"> "Wah...!?"<br>
<br>
Someone suddenly talks to me.</i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/snap114.jpg" alt="" class="img" border="0"><br>
<br>
<b>It's Squall!</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0"> <i>"I came here for a job interview..."<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/shunt.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0"> "Oh, it's you...Akina, the manager, told me about you. Come on in."<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0"> "Eh...oh...thank you..."<br>
<br>
The guy leads me into the restaurant. I'm so nervous, my voice screeches.</i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/snap121.jpg" alt="" class="img" border="0"><br>
<br>
<b>Welcome to Platinum. We'll be doing some fucking here.</b><br>
<br>
<i>As he slowly walks in front of me, he hums. Does he work here? He's tall and masculine...He must be popular with
girls. I wish I were like him.</i><br>
<br>
<b>You're getting less and less masculine and we've just barely met you, Yuk.</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/snap127.jpg" alt="" class="img" border="0"><br>
<br>
<b>And here's the office. Fucking is to be had here, too.</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/shunt.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">: <i>"Here you go...Well, she's not here...What the hell is she doing?"<br>
<br>
He scratches his head and sulkily smiles at me. I haven't heard his name yet.<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/shunt.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0"> "I'll bring the manager. Have a seat."<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0"> "Ah...yes. Thank you very much." 
<br>
My voice screeches again.<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/shunt.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0"> "Ha-ha-ha. Don't be nervous. I won't bother you. I have a family."<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0"> "Ha...huh?" 
<br>
He won't bother me...? Does he...<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0"> "Shuntaro? What are you doing here?"<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/shunt.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0"> "Oh, Akina...I mean Boss. I brought her here. She came here for the interview."</i><br>
<br>
<b>Double iceburn, Yukari. Sucks to be you.</b><br>
<br>
<i>He turns around and smiles at me.</i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/snap142.jpg" alt="" class="img" border="0"><br>
<br>
<b>Neat.</b><br>
<br>
<i>The lady looks at him, as if he were her little brother. I don't know how to react.<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0"> "Oh...?"<br>
<br>
She finally notices me.<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0"> "Are you the one who called...?"<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0"> "Yes! I'm Yukari Fujisawa. Nice to meet you!"<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0"> "............"<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0"> "...um?"<br>
<br>
She must be the one I talked to on the phone the other day. She suspiciously looks at me.<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0"> "Let's start the interview, Mr. Fujisawa."<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0"> "Alright!"<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/shunt.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0"> "Eh...? Mr...? Akina...!?"</i><br>
<br>
<b>Yes, he IS a dude, dickweasal.</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0"> "<i>Go out and clean up, please."<br>
<br>
She's gently smiling, but she has a tone of authority in her voice. She's a so-called career woman.</i><br>
<br>
<b>That line kills me. "So-called career woman." Kind of like saying,
"she thinks she's a business manager but in reality she's just there
cause she's pretty. We all know women can't run businesses."</b><br>
<br>
<i>She pushes him out of the room.<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">: I'll kill you if you peep in here."<br>
<br>
Uh-...
<br>
She throws him an icy look. I thought she was kind...<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">: Please have a seat over there."</i><br>
<br>
<u>KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK!</u> <b>He's knocking on the door during an interview. What an asshole.</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">: <i>"Hah..."</i><br>
<br>
<u>KNOCK, KNOCK!</u><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">: <i>"Is he OK?" I point at the door.<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0"> "Leave him alone. I'll introduce him to you later."<br>
<br>
He stops knocking after a while, and she comes to me shrugging.<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0"> "We finally can sit down and talk...Nice to meet you. I'm Akina Inamura, the manager at Platinum."</i><br>
<br>
<b>"I'm happy to <i>meat</i> you too, Akina.</b>"<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0"> "...................."<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">: <i>"Are you OK?"</i><br>
<br>
<b>He's terrified in the presence of women, can't you tell?</b><br>
<br>
<i><img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0"> "Ah...yes...I'm OK...Nice to meet you, too. I'm Yukari Fujisawa."<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0"> "He-he..."<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">: She knows what I'm thinking...I blush.</i><br>
<br>
<b>This is it! Sex time!</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">: <i>Wow...how cute. I can't blame Shuntaro for mistaking you for a girl."</i><br>
<br>
...<b>from erect to flacid in five seconds flat.</b><br>
<br>
<i><img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0"> "Ah...he did? That's what I thought." I was so nervous, I
sounded like a girl...Now I understand why he treated me like that.<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0"> "He-he...He used to be a famous playboy. After he got married, he lost his insight into girls. Ha-ha-ha!"<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0"> "Hah..."<br>
<br>
Ms. Inamura laughs hard.<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0"> "Actually, I thought you were a girl until we met. I'm sorry...I thought you were a girl from your name and your voice."<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0"> "People do that all the time...:emo:"<br>
<br>
I'm used to being mistaken for a girl, but I've never met
someone as honest as her. Come to think of it, her attitude is strong
and favorable. I almost forgot why I'm here.<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0"> "Ah...by the way, are you only looking for girls?"<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0"> "Actually, yes."<br>
<br>
She nods her head. She gives me a definite answer. I droop my
shoulders. There's no way I can get this job because I'm a boy.</i><br>
<br>
<b>DENIED BY THE DONG. Jesus, man, you just can't catch a break, can you?"</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0"> "<i>We only have waitresses here. Only girls can do the job. But two girls suddenly quit. We need someone as soon as possible."<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0"> "I see..." Only girls can do the job...?<br>
<br>
:pervert:<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0"> "Um..."<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0"> "Yes...?" Ms. Inamura looks into my face. And...<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/snap204.jpg" alt="" class="img" border="0"><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0"> "Eh?"<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0"> "It's good for our restaurant to have a unisexual appeal. We have female customers too."<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0"> "Huh? What?"</i><br>
<br>
<b>"You lost me after '...sexual...'."</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">: <i>"You're hired!" She cheerfully declares.</i><br>
