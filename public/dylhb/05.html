<br>
<i>I feel sad
about this comment, but I can't blame her. They watched me when I was
about to have sex. Besides, one of them is my cousin! </i><br>
<br>
<b>...what does this have to do with being a boy? Are you implying she had to clarify because she does a lot of lesbian shit? :|</b><br>
<br>

<br>
<b>Most awkward greeting <i>ever</i></b>.<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">: <i>She deeply bows but doesn't look at me. She's either embarrassed or very polite. </i><br>
<br>
<b>She caught you in the buff right after you plugged her boss. That's a pretty intimidating first impression.</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">: <i>She doesn't look like the type of girl who likes to work as a bunny girl. </i><br>

<b>"Sae <i>knows</i> someone? What is this voodoo!?</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">: <i>They're surprised because we suddenly greet each other friendly. I'm surprised too. I didn't expect to see her here.</i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">: <i>She's my
cousin, Sae Ishigami. She's the same age as me. Her last name's
different from mine because her father (my father's little brother) was
adopted into his wife's family. We saw each other often before
elementary school. We got busy and didn't see each other much after
that.</i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">: <i>She lives near
my house, but since we go to different schools, we don't see each other
very often. I saw her on New Year's Day. We played a lot when we were
little. Maybe that's why I'm so feminine...</i><br>
<br>
<b>About Sae (spoilers): <span class="bbc-spoiler" onmouseover="this.style.color='#FFFFFF';" onmouseout="this.style.color=this.style.backgroundColor='#000000'">&nbsp;Yes, Sae is one of the girls that we can end up having sex with. <i>Yes</i>,
she's our cousin. I'll give you all a minute to huff loudly and mutter
&#8220;shameful" under your breath. When you're done, join me in what I like
to call &#8220;saying it before you do":<br>
<br>
OH MY GOD. THAT'S HIS FUCKING COUSIN. THAT'S SICK. WHAT THE HELL, BLOOD
RELATED EVEN. THAT'S NOT ONLY DISGUSTING, IT'S INCESTOUS! WHAT IS WRONG
WITH JAPAN?! THIS IS A TERRIBLE GAME, YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BROUGHT IN
BLIND FOUR YEAR OLDS TO RAPE BECAUSE THIS IS THE WORST THING EVER.<br>
<br>
It's his cousin, one that he hardly ever sees. In Hgames, this is
pretty minor. Get over it. Not that I'm condoning incest, by any means,
but Sae's cool, alright? Don't jump all over her case. It's certainly
not any worse then games where you're killing thousands of people. <img src="1_files/frown.gif" alt="" border="0">&nbsp;</span> Now. Back to the scene in progress.</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/sae.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:<i> "He's my cousin." </i><br>

<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0"> <i>"Yeah..."</i><br>
<br>
<b>What a thrilling conversation.</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">: <i>All the people in the room are looking at us, and I look down at the floor... Sae is imposing, though. </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/shunt.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0"> <i>"Well, I thought you two used to date or are actually dating right now." </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/sae.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:<i> "No way. Our relationship isn't that romantic." </i><br>
<br>
<b><i>'That</i> romantic.' Nice wording, there, Sae.</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">: <i>Sae catches up with this frivolous looking guy. Akina nods her head and Hiromi timidly glances at me. By the way...</i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/sae.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:<i> "Um? What's wrong, Yukari?" </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0"> <i>"Ah...I'm just trying to believe you're really a bunny girl." </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/sae.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:<i> "He-he. Aren't I cute?" </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/snap526.jpg" alt="" class="img" border="0"><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">: <i>She's wearing the dress, which is like a thong, a bow tie, and bunny ears. Now I understand why this place is so popular...</i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">: <i>Sae actually looks very cute. She's pretty to begin with, but this costume emphasizes her gorgeous body. </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/snap531.jpg" alt="" class="img" border="0"><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">: <i>Why does she wear her glasses...?</i><br>
<br>
<b>So she doesn't run into stuff, dumbshit. </b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">: <i>It looks unbalanced, but it makes her look even sexier... Besides, her boobs are bigger than Sae's.</i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0"> <i>"GULP..."</i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/hiromi.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:<i> "Ah...please don't stare at me..."</i><br>
<br>
<b>"Also, please stop yelling &#8216;GULP' at me. It's creepy.</b>"<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0"> <i>"Eh? Oh...I'm sorry!" </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/hiromi.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:<i> "No...that's OK." </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">: <i>She looks down at the floor again. If she's so shy...then, why this job...!? I can't believe she works here. </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0"> <i>"Well, work hard, girls! We'll have a welcome party for Yukari after work today." Akina looks like a career woman again. </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/sae.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:<i> "Oh? But Ryo and Chimaki..."</i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0"> <i>"Don't
worry. I'll call them and tell them to come after work. Yukari, you can
either go home or stay here until the restaurant closes tonight." </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/snap547.jpg" alt="" class="img" border="0"><br>
<br>
<b>What kind of loser goes home early on his first day on the job?</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">: <i>I imagine there're so many things I have to learn. &#8220;Can I stay here and learn the routine...?"</i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0"> <i>"Wow, what a good boy. I'm glad we have you here." </i><br>
<br>
<b>"This has nothing at all to do with the dongfest we had twenty minutes ago.</b>"<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0"> <i>"Sae, could you please show him the menu and the other things he'd better know?" </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/sae.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:<i> "All right."</i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0"> <i>"I'll
serve customers too. We don't have that many reservations tonight. You
can stay here until we get too busy." Akina meaningfully smiles at me
and leaves. </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">: <i>Shuntaro and Hiromi leave too. Now...only Sae and I are left in the room. </i><br>
<br>
Subtle music change.<br>

<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0"> <i>"..............." </i><br>

<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">: <i>...this is uncomfortable. She looked at me naked, having sex with Akina, and she's in a bunny girl costume now...</i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/sae.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:<i> "He-he..."</i><br>

<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0"> <i>"You haven't changed that much either, Sae." I don't
know where to look. She looks so sexy. I think we took a bath together
when we were kids. </i><br>

<b>Jesus, dude, FOCUS.</b><br>

<img src="1_files/sae.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:<i> "Hey, don't worry about this costume, alright? We used to take baths together, don't you remember?" </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">: <i>Does she know what I'm thinking!? </i><br>
<br>
<b>It's not too hard when your eyes are glued to her tits and you're salivating.</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/sae.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:<i> "You
surprised me. I didn't expect to see you working here..." She blushes and
smiles. &#8220;I also didn't expect you to become Akina's victim." </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0"> <i>"No...ah...that was...!" I can feel I'm blushing all the
way up to my ears. I don't know why, but I'm trying to make up an
excuse. &#8220;Akina told me it was her job to measure everyone..."</i><br>
<br>
<b>"...and then she sucked my dick three times. I'M INNOCENT DAMN IT.</b>"<br>

a very sexual person, and she doesn't try to hide it. She loves
beautiful boys. It's no wonder she got you right away. She's so honest
with herself." </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">: <i>Sae doesn't seem to care that much about the
incident. I guess she doesn't hate or look down on me because of it. I
feel relieved and depressed at the same time...</i><br>

are you ready to learn about your job...? I'll explain how to greet
customers, things you'd better remember, and the menu if you still have

my mind...</i><br>
