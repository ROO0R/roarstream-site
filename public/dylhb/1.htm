		<sub><img src="1_files/emot-nws.gif" alt="" border="0"> <b>Disclaimer</b>:  As you should expect by the fact that the name of this game has the word "horny" in it, <b>this entire thread is deemed NOT WORK SAFE</b>.  If you are reading this at work you are already fucked so get out while you still can!  This game does <br>
incorporate massive amounts of tits and ass and all of which will be
censored if embedded or linked. Just please don't send me a PM saying
how much of a cock I am because Sae's tits got you fired. <img src="1_files/emot-nws.gif" alt="" border="0"></sub><br>

<img src="1_files/Title.png" alt="" class="img" border="0"><br>
<br>
Following the glorious LP tradition of bringing the joy of playing
games to those without the gumption to play them themselves, I have
brought to the table a game that most of you have probably heard of but
have never played...<i>H na Bunny-san Kirai</i>, or in non-moonspeak, <i>Do You Like Horny Bunnies?</i><br>
<br>
I am aware of the fact that this game was covered by the SA Hgame
reviews a few years back. Hell, that's how I found out about the game.
Well, despite the fact that the review was relatively positive compared
to most, mainly the negatives were featured as the highlights of the
game. I contend that this is as fine a game that the wacky Japanese
have ever put out, with real emotions and feelings and<br>
<br>
oh fuck it this is about sex.  It's just a fun game and that's why I want to do it so if you have a problem with <img src="1_files/emot-sonia.gif" alt="" border="0"> then fuck off <img src="1_files/emot-v.gif" alt="" border="0">.<br>
<br>
As the workstation I'm at is a shared computer, updates will be
approximately "less than I would like to", since - despite the fact
that I'm 23 and damn well able to look at porn - respect dictates I
wait until females are not in range.<br>
<br>
With that...<br>
<br>
<b>The ladies!</b><br>

		<b>Chapter One:  A Part-time Beginning</b><br>
<sub>With a suprising lack of, you know, chicks.</sub><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/snap004.jpg" alt="" class="img" border="0"><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">: <i>I haven't felt
excited for a long time. My school is one of the most prestigious
schools in this area: both teachers and students are good. It's always
good to have many friends.</i><br>
<br>
<b>This guy sounds like a winner already.</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">: <i>My name is
Yukari Fujisawa. I'm a senior at Kinozaka High School. Since this
spring, I've started living by myself because my family had to move,
due to my father's job. I decided to stay here because I have school
and I want to go to college here.<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">: My hobbies are
reading, raising tropical fish, and I sometimes practice judo. My
grades are pretty good (I think...), but I don't have good reflexes. (I
can't ride a bicycle...)<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">: I'm not picky
about food. I don't hate any particular person, and I'm not hated by
anyone (I hope). I don't believe in ghosts, monsters, or those kinds of
stuff. <br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  In the future, I want to be an ordinary businessman, or I want a job that has something to do with tropical fish.</i><br>
<br>
<b>Christ, give us your whole life story please. Only about a third of
this information ever comes up again later. Tl;dr version: I LIVE
ALONE, I SOMETIMES PRACTICE MARTIAL ARTS AND I'M ABSOLUTE APESHIT FOR
TROPICAL FISH.</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>It's sad to say, but I don't look my age.  I'm not manly at all.  I guess judo hasn't helped my physique.  <img src="1_files/emot-emo.gif" alt="" border="0">  I don't think you want to know my bust, waist, or hip sizes.  However, people often ask me.</i><br>
<br>
<b>You mean like, randomly, on the street?  "Hello there!  What's your bust size?"</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>You'll say, 'how come?'  Because of my figure and feminine appearance.</i><br>
<br>
<b>Ah, the good old "look like a chick" method that anime loves so
much. All you need is martial arts training and you can get syndicated
on Adult Swim. ...wait, you've got that. I'll look up their number.</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/livestock01-14-04-whore.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>Have
I ever liked this feminine face? Never! People thought I was a girl
when I was little. My mom forced me to wear a girl's kimono for the
Seven-Five-Three Festival, boys gave me chocolate on Valentine's day,
and I've been lead to ladies restrooms or locker rooms many times.</i><br>
<br>
<b>You know, if I were Yukari, I would've totally taken advantage of
all of this. "Wait, this is the ladies changing room. Sure, yeah,
that's totally where I wanted to go!"</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>And...</i><br>
<br>
Insert fade-away to memory...<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/snap026.jpg" alt="" class="img" border="0"><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/snap027.jpg" alt="" class="img" border="0"><br>
<i><br>
<img src="1_files/emot-j.gif" alt="" border="0">1:  "Ha-ha-ha!  You look better in a girl's uniform than in a boy's uniform."<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-j.gif" alt="" border="0">2:  "That's right.  I'm sure you'd look good in a frilled dress."<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-iceburn.gif" alt="" border="0"><br>
<img src="1_files/emot-j.gif" alt="" border="0">1:  "I'm happy to have a friend like you, but it's difficult to see you as a boy..."<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-iceburn.gif" alt="" border="0"> <img src="1_files/emot-iceburn.gif" alt="" border="0"><br>
<img src="1_files/emot-j.gif" alt="" border="0">2:  "Really?  I didn't know that you saw him like that."<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-j.gif" alt="" border="0">1:  "N,no...He's a very good friend."<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-j.gif" alt="" border="0">2:  "Right?  Ha-ha-ha."</i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/snap034.jpg" alt="" class="img" border="0"><br>
<br>
<b>The game does this a LOT.  Twice in a row.  Yukari has a lot to think about ALL OF THE FUCKING TIME.</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>I'm used to
hearing girls say things like this. However this time, it's a different
story because I like this girl...She's one of the most gorgeous girls
in our school. I know she's far beyond my reach. <img src="1_files/emot-emo.gif" alt="" border="0">  But I hope she sees me as a boy at least.</i><br>
<br>
<b>Yeah she pretty much JUST said that she didn't.</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>It's the beginning of summer. The sun starts to shine
strong. Looking up at the bright sky, I feel empty going home by myself.<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  "I can't argue with her, though..."<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  I sigh and slowly walk home.</i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/snap042.jpg" alt="" class="img" border="0"><br>
<br>
<b>Welcome to the pad.  Aside from the bathroom, which we'll see later in the game...<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/snap048.jpg" alt="" class="img" border="0"><br>
<br>
And this main room, there's not really much to look at.  I think it's a studio at best.</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>"I'm back."<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">: Nobody answers. I feel lonely. I have a big family. My little
sisters were so annoying, but I miss them now...Only three Angelfish
welcome me home. I was the one who wanted to stay here, so I can't
complain.<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  I put down my bag and hang up my jacket.  It's too hot to go outside with a jacket.<br>
<br>
:words: :words: :words:<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  We'll change our uniforms to summer ones soon.  My slim figure will be even more noticable...</i><br>
<br>
<b>And then the boys will really swoon.  :swoon:</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>"Hah..."<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">: I sit on my bed and look at the papers piled up on the floor. I
don't read them everyday. "I like to read papers, but not everyday...I
wish they would deliver papers every other day or once every three
days..."</i><br>
<br>
<b>I don't know why he chose to say that last sentence out loud.</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>We can always see the news on TV or through the
Internet. "However, if I stop subscribing to the paper, they'll keep
nagging me for subscriptions..." That'd be annoying. I feel tired just
thinking about it.</i><br>
<br>
<b>I'm going to toss out a wild guess here and say that Yukari's still a virgin.</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>If I were pushy like others, people wouldn't say I look like a girl..."<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  I tend to worry about people too much.  I don't think I can be a sales person.<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  "It's not good to think so negatively!"</i><br>
<br>
<b>That's right, Yukari!  You tell those angelfish who's boss!</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>I guess I'm still in shock.  I have to do something to be treated as a man.<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  "Should I start practicing judo again?  Or should I get a physical part time job?"<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  A flier flutters down from a bundle of papers.</i><br>
<br>
<b>It's a gift from God!</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>"Part time job information...huh?"<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">: My parents send me enough money every month. All I want are
books and stuff for my tropical fish... However, those are not cheap.<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">: "Maybe... I should get a part time job." I've never done it,
and I have enough time. Studying won't help me to become macho.
"Well..."<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">: My goals for physical labor are: 1. Train my body, 2. Save
money to buy a bigger aquarium, 3. ...I'll think about it later!<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  "This is the 'To Be A Man Project' by Yukari Fujisawa!"</i><br>
<br>
<b>I'm having flashbacks to Mulan right now.  Maybe I should just call him Ping throughout the rest of the damn story.</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>I'll change by the end of summer.  ....... As a result, I might get a girlfriend.  Needless to say, that's my third goal.</i><br>
<br>
Next time:  An actual girl finds her way into the story!

		<b>Chapter 2:  Better than Gold</b><br>
<sub>get it platinum is better than gold</sub><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>I&#8217;ve looked through some job magazines, and I found work at a restaurant.  It&#8217;s an Italian restaurant called &#8216;Platinum.&#8217;</i><br>
<br>
<b>Which, if I don&#8217;t say so myself, is a damn cool name for a
restaurant. &#8216;I had lunch the other day at that restaurant.&#8217; &#8216;oh which-&#8216;
&#8216;MOTHERFUCKING PLATINUM BABY.&#8217;</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>It&#8217;s close to my house, the work doesn&#8217;t sound too tough, and they&#8217;ll pay me good&#8230; It&#8217;s a perfect place to work!</i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>I&#8217;m going for an interview now.</i><br>
<br>
A scene shift later&#8230;<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;Hah&#8230;hah&#8230; I thought the restaurant was close to my house&#8230; but I can&#8217;t find it.&#8221;<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">: I&#8217;m lost. I&#8217;m sure
I&#8217;m close. I thought it was going to take only 15 minutes or so to get
there, but I&#8217;ve been walking for more than half an hour. I&#8217;ve been
wandering around this area for a long time&#8230; I may look like a pervert.</i><br>
<br>
<b>This is why we find out where the hell things are before we apply to work for them.</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;Usually, restaurants have big signs&#8230;&#8221;<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  I don&#8217;t often go out to eat at restaurants, so I don&#8217;t know what to look for&#8230;<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  &#8220;Hah&#8230; Is it a small restaurant?&#8221;<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  However, they are offering too much money for just a small restaurant.</i><br>
<br>
<b>That&#8217;s right.  You only make REAL money at big chains, like Olive Garden.</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>The info I got
from the flier mentioned that it&#8217;s an Italian restaurant, and they need
someone to help, and how much they&#8217;ll pay.<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  &#8220;It might be an underground restaurant where they always have to keep bouncers&#8230;&#8221;</i><br>
<br>
<b>Yeah, apply good luck applying for THAT job, girlboy.</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>Well, I don&#8217;t
think so&#8230;&#8221;Oh...I&#8217;ll be late&#8230;&#8221; I&#8217;m glad I left early. But I might be
late, even though I left early&#8230;If I&#8217;m late for the interview, I&#8217;m sure
I won&#8217;t get the job. I won&#8217;t be able to find such a good offer
somewhere else!<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  &#8220;I&#8217;d better try to find the restaurant&#8230;ah&#8230;&#8221;</i><br>
<br>
<b>JESUS.  YOU&#8217;RE LATE.  WE GET IT.  Instead of talking about, why don&#8217;t you, you know, look around some more?&#8221;</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/snap106.jpg" alt="" class="img" border="0"><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>&#8220;What was I looking for&#8230;&#8221;<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  I droop my shoulders&#8230;I don&#8217;t have time to be like this.  I look at my watch.  I have five minutes before the interview.<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  &#8220;Good&#8230; I made it.&#8221;<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-v.gif" alt="" border="0">:  &#8220;You made what?&#8221;<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  &#8220;Wah&#8230;!?&#8221;<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  Someone suddenly talks to me.</i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/snap114.jpg" alt="" class="img" border="0"><br>
<br>
<b>It&#8217;s Squall!</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">  <i>&#8220;I came here for a job interview&#8230;&#8221;<br>

<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  &#8220;Eh&#8230;oh&#8230;thank you&#8230;&#8221;<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  The guy leads me into the restaurant.  I&#8217;m so nervous, my voice screeches.</i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/snap121.jpg" alt="" class="img" border="0"><br>
<br>
<b>Welcome to Platinum.  We&#8217;ll be doing some fucking here.</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>As he slowly walks in front of me, he hums. &#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;
&#8230;does he work here? He&#8217;s tall and masculine&#8230; He must be popular with
girls. I wish I were like him.</i><br>
<br>
<b>You&#8217;re getting less and less masculine and we&#8217;ve just barely met you, Yuk.</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/snap127.jpg" alt="" class="img" border="0"><br>
<br>
<b>And here&#8217;s the office.  Fucking is to be had here, too.</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/shunt.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;Here you go&#8230;Well, she&#8217;s not here&#8230; What the hell is she doing?&#8221;<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  He scratches his head and sulkily smiles at me.  I haven&#8217;t heard his name yet.<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/shunt.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:  &#8220;I&#8217;ll bring the manager.  Have a seat.&#8221;<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  &#8220;Ah&#8230;yes.  Thank you very much.&#8221;  My voice screeches again.<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/shunt.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:  &#8220;Ha-ha-ha.  Don&#8217;t be nervous.  I won&#8217;t bother you.  I have a family.&#8221;<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  &#8220;Ha&#8230;huh?&#8221;  He won&#8217;t bother me&#8230;?  Does he&#8230;<br>
<br>
:j::  &#8220;Shuntaro?  What are you doing here?&#8221;<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/shunt.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:  &#8220;Oh, Akina&#8230;I mean Boss.  I brought <u>her</u> here.  <u>She</u> came here for the interview.&#8221;</i><br>
<br>
<b>Double :iceburn: at you, Yukari.  Sucks to be you, chicky.</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>He turns around and smiles at me.</i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/snap142.jpg" alt="" class="img" border="0"><br>
<br>
<b>:awesome:</b><br>

<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  She finally notices me.<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:  &#8220;Are you the one who called&#8230;?&#8221;<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  &#8220;Yes!  I&#8217;m Yukari Fujisawa.  Nice to meet you!&#8221;<br>

<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  She must be the one I talked to on the phone the other day.  She suspiciously looks at me.<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:  &#8220;Let&#8217;s start the interview, Mr. Fujisawa.&#8221;<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  &#8220;Alright!&#8221;<br>

<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  She&#8217;s gently smiling, but she has a tone of authority in her voice.  She&#8217;s a so-called career woman.</i><br>
<br>
<b>That line kills me. &#8220;So-called career woman.&#8221; Kind of like saying,
&#8220;she thinks she&#8217;s a business manager but in reality she&#8217;s just there
cause she&#8217;s pretty. We all know women can&#8217;t run businesses.&#8221;</b><br>

<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>She pushes him out of the room.<br>

<br>
:pwn:<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  She throws him an icy look.<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  &#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;  I thought she was kind&#8230;<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:  Please have a seat over there.&#8221;</i><br>
<br>
<u>KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK!</u>  <b>He's knocking on the door during an interview.  What an asshole.</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>&#8220;Hah&#8230;&#8221;</i><br>
<br>
<u>KNOCK, KNOCK!</u><br>

<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>&#8220;Is he OK?&#8221;  I point at the door.<br>

<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  He stops knocking after a while, and she comes to me shrugging.<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:  &#8220;We finally can sit down and talk&#8230; Nice to meet you.  I&#8217;m Akina Inamura, the manager at Platinum.&#8221;</i><br>

<b>&#8221;I&#8217;m happy to <i>meat</i> you too, Akina.  :pervert:</b>&#8221;<br>

<b>He&#8217;s terrified in the presence of women, can&#8217;t you tell?</b><br>

<br>
&#8230;<b>from :dong: to :flaccid: in five seconds flat.</b><br>
<br>
<i><img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">: &#8220;Ah&#8230;he did? That&#8217;s what I thought.&#8221; I was so nervous, I
sounded like a girl&#8230; Now I understand why he treated me like that.<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:  &#8220;He-he&#8230; He used to be a famous playboy.  After he got married, he lost his insight into girls.  Ha-ha-ha!&#8221;<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  &#8220;Hah&#8230;&#8221;<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  Ms. Inamura laughs hard.<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:  &#8220;Actually, I thought you were a girl until we met.  I&#8217;m sorry&#8230; I thought you were a girl from your name and your voice.&#8221;<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  &#8220;People do that all the time&#8230;:emo:&#8221;<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">: I&#8217;m used to being mistaken for a girl, but I&#8217;ve never met
someone as honest as her. Come to think of it, her attitude is strong
and favorable. I almost forgot why I&#8217;m here.<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  &#8220;Ah&#8230;by the way, are you only looking for girls?&#8221;<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:  &#8220;Actually, yes.&#8221;<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">: She nods her head. She gives me a definite answer. I droop my
shoulders. There&#8217;s no way I can get this job because I&#8217;m a boy.</i><br>
<br>
<b>DENIED BY THE DONG.  Jesus, man, you just can&#8217;t catch a break, can you?&#8221;</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:  &#8220;<i>We only have waitresses here.  Only girls can do the job.  But two girls suddenly quit.  We need someone as soon as possible.&#8221;<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  &#8220;I see&#8230;&#8221;  Only girls can do the job&#8230;?<br>
<br>
:pervert:<br>

<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:  &#8220;Um&#8230;&#8221;<br>

<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  &#8220;Eh?&#8221;<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:  &#8220;It&#8217;s good for our restaurant to have a unisexual appeal.  We have female customers too.&#8221;<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  &#8220;Huh?  What?&#8221;</i><br>
<br>

X-Change was actually relatively tame, from what I remember when I
played it six years ago. Well, save for your stepsister raping you
literally 10 minutes after you turn into a chick. Or the ending where
you get caught fucking your gym teacher and he gets fired and you end
up having like nine kids together and being miserable for the rest of
your life.<br>
<br>
Never played Crescendo.  Tried to make it through the LP, but haven't gotten the chance to get past the first page yet.

I wouldn't call X-Change "tame" so much, but it's not as bad as
something like Crescendo, I don't think. There's a bunch of scenes in
it that are more than questionable, like the infamous Rape Bus scene
and the sister-rape (if I remember right, you have sex with/get raped
by or something involving your sister's boyfriend, too?), and a whole
lot of general woman-demeaning. And yes, there is a shota-quality boy
you can have sex with, he leaves a note in your shoe or something. I've
only played it once and that was a long time ago, but I remember it
only being rather crappy.<br>
</blockquote></div>

<br>
Oh, I never said it was a <i>good</i> game.  It's just that when you play games like Love Potion, X-Change seems really watered down.

Excuse me, what?<br>

<div class="bbc-block"><h4>go ask alice or whatever posted:</h4><blockquote>Dear Alice,<br>
<br>
My girlfriend and I have oral sex. I heard that if you blow in the vagina of a female that it could kill her. Is that true? <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Dear Reader,<br>
<br>
Yes, it's a true but very rare occurrence. When air is blown or forced
directly into a vagina &#8212; without allowing any air to escape &#8212; an air
embolism (the abnormal presence of air in the cardiovascular system)
could form, which can be fatal. Women who are more at risk for this
unlikely possibility are those whose pelvic vessels are enlarged
(meaning, increased blood supply to the vagina) due to a condition such
as trauma and possibly pregnancy. So, if a very large amount of air
were to be blown or forced into their vaginal canals, it's possible
that the air could enter their bloodstream, causing a blockage in a
blood vessel. As a result, some of these women, perhaps including the
pregnant women's fetus, may experience complications. In extraordinary
cases, some of these women (and the fetus) may die if the embolism
travels to the heart or lungs. <br>
<br>
If you like blowing air into your girlfriend's vulva, and if your
girlfriend enjoys the sensations brought on by this, it may give you
two some peace of mind to know that gently puffing some air into or
breathing on a woman's vulva during oral pleasuring appears to be okay.
However, it might be better to suck, kiss, lick, probe, press (with
lips or fingers), or lightly nibble a woman's vulva or clitoris than
blow or force air directly into her vagina. Safer and enjoyable oral
sex on a woman mostly involves using a dam, finding out what feels good
to her, and practice. <br>
<br>
The answer, my friend, is not blowin' in the women. <br>

not any worse then games where you&#8217;re killing thousands of people. <img src="1_files/frown.gif" alt="" border="0">&nbsp;</span>  Now.  Back to the scene in progress.</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/sae.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:<i>  &#8221;He&#8217;s my cousin.&#8221; </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;Oh&#8230;really.&#8221; </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;Yeah&#8230;&#8221;</i><br>
<br>
<b>What a thrilling conversation.</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>All the people in the room are looking at us, and I look down at the floor&#8230; Sae is imposing, though. </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/shunt.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;Well, I thought you two used to date or are actually dating right now.&#8221; </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/sae.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:<i>  &#8221;No way.  Our relationship isn&#8217;t that romantic.&#8221; </i><br>
<br>
<b><i>&#8217;That</i> romantic.&#8217;  Nice wording, there, Sae.</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>Sae catches up with this frivolous looking guy.  Akina nods her head and Hiromi timidly glances at me.  By the way&#8230;</i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/sae.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:<i>  &#8221;Um?  What&#8217;s wrong, Yukari?&#8221; </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;Ah&#8230;I&#8217;m just trying to believe you&#8217;re really a bunny girl.&#8221; </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/sae.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:<i>  &#8221;He-he.  Aren&#8217;t I cute?&#8221; </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/snap526.jpg" alt="" class="img" border="0"><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>She&#8217;s wearing the dress, which is like a thong, a bow tie, and bunny ears.  Now I understand why this place is so popular&#8230;</i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>Sae actually looks very cute.  She&#8217;s pretty to begin with, but this costume emphasizes her gorgeous body. </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/snap531.jpg" alt="" class="img" border="0"><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>Why does she wear her glasses&#8230;?</i><br>
<br>
<b>So she doesn&#8217;t run into stuff, dumbshit. </b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>It looks unbalanced, but it makes her look even sexier&#8230; Besides, her boobs are bigger than Sae&#8217;s.</i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;GULP&#8230;&#8221;</i><br>

<br>
<b>&#8221;Also, please stop yelling &#8216;GULP&#8217; at me.  It&#8217;s creepy.</b>&#8221;<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;Eh?  Oh&#8230;I&#8217;m sorry!&#8221; </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/hiromi.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:<i>  &#8221;No&#8230;that&#8217;s OK.&#8221; </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>She looks down at the floor again.  If she&#8217;s so shy&#8230;then, why this job&#8230;!?  I can&#8217;t believe she works here. </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;Well, work hard, girls!  We&#8217;ll have a welcome party for Yukari after work today.&#8221;  Akina looks like a career woman again. </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/sae.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:<i>  &#8221;Oh?  But Ryo and Chimaki&#8230;&#8221;</i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;Don&#8217;t
worry. I&#8217;ll call them and tell them to come after work. Yukari, you can
either go home or stay here until the restaurant closes tonight.&#8221; </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/snap547.jpg" alt="" class="img" border="0"><br>
<br>
<b>What kind of loser goes home early on his first day on the job?</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>I imagine there&#8217;re so many things I have to learn.  &#8220;Can I stay here and learn the routine&#8230;?&#8221;</i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;Wow, what a good boy.  I&#8217;m glad we have you here.&#8221; </i><br>
<br>
<b>&#8221;This has nothing at all to do with the dongfest we had twenty minutes ago.</b>&#8221;<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;Sae, could you please show him the menu and the other things he&#8217;d better know?&#8221; </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/sae.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:<i>  &#8221;All right.&#8221;</i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/akina.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;I&#8217;ll
serve customers too. We don&#8217;t have that many reservations tonight. You
can stay here until we get too busy.&#8221; Akina meaningfully smiles at me
and leaves. </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>Shuntaro and Hiromi leave too.  Now&#8230;only Sae and I are left in the room. </i><br>
<br>
Subtle music change.<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221; </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/sae.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:<i>  &#8221;.............&#8220;</i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>&#8230;this is uncomfortable.  She looked at me naked, having sex with Akina, and she&#8217;s in a bunny girl costume now&#8230;</i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/sae.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:<i>  &#8221;He-he&#8230;&#8221;</i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;Eh?&#8217; </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/sae.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:<i>  &#8221;You haven&#8217;t changed at all, Yukari. </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;You haven&#8217;t changed that much either, Sae.&#8221; I don&#8217;t
know where to look. She looks so sexy. I think we took a bath together
when we were kids. </i><br>
<br>
<b>Jesus, dude, FOCUS.</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/sae.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:<i>  &#8221;Hey, don&#8217;t worry about this costume, alright?  We used to take baths together, don&#8217;t you remember?&#8221; </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>Does she know what I&#8217;m thinking!? </i><br>
<br>
<b>It&#8217;s not too hard when your eyes are glued to her tits and you&#8217;re salivating.</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/sae.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:<i> &#8221;You
surprised me. I didn&#8217;t expect to see you working here&#8230;&#8221; She blushes and
smiles. &#8220;I also didn&#8217;t expect you to become Akina&#8217;s victim.&#8221; </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;No&#8230;ah&#8230;that was&#8230;!&#8221; I can feel I&#8217;m blushing all the
way up to my ears. I don&#8217;t know why, but I&#8217;m trying to make up an
excuse. &#8220;Akina told me it was her job to measure everyone&#8230;&#8221;</i><br>

<img src="1_files/sae.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:<i> &#8221;Akina&#8217;s
a very sexual person, and she doesn&#8217;t try to hide it. She loves
beautiful boys. It&#8217;s no wonder she got you right away. She&#8217;s so honest
with herself.&#8221; </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>Sae doesn&#8217;t seem to care that much about the

feel relieved and depressed at the same time&#8230;</i><br>

<b>Yukari:  Hi!<br>
Chefs:  OH MY GOD RUN FOR YOUR LIFE</b><br>
<br>
<i>The chefs don&#8217;t speak much Japanese, so Shuntaro and Akina helped us

<br>
<i>Actually, I thought about it a little, but I won&#8217;t tell her. The
girls are all unique and pretty. Besides, I&#8217;ll be able to see them in
bunny costumes everyday. I&#8217;m not stupid enough to quit this job.</i><br>
<br>
<b>Best decision ever.</b><br>
<br>
<i>I&#8217;m not lecherous, and I don&#8217;t think all guys like bunny girls.  I really don&#8217;t&#8230;</i><br>
<br>
<b>Sure.  :jerkbag:</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/sae.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;Um&#8230;?  What are you thinking?&#8221; </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;Ah&#8230;nothing&#8230;!&#8221;</i><br>
<br>

<br>
<b>How dare she interrupt my inner monologue!  I&#8217;m all out of order now!</b><br>

<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;Don&#8217;t worry.  I&#8217;ll be happy to work with you guys.  Oh&#8230;"</i><br>

<br>
<i>I sigh with relief. </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/sae.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;They&#8217;ve
been working at Platinum since they were young. They naturally learned
Italian through talking with the chefs. Shuntaro married a waitress,
who&#8217;s Akina&#8217;s best friend. Shuntaro and Akina are still good friends.&#8221; </i><br>
<br>
<b>Kinda getting off subject here</b>.<br>
<br>
<i>I see&#8230;it&#8217;s interesting to hear about their history. </i><br>
<br>

<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;Eh?  Is that true?&#8221; </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/sae.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;That&#8217;s what Chimaki thinks!&#8221;</i><br>
<br>
<b>Okay, why the shit are you trusting <i>anything</i> Chimaki ever says?</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;Oh, it&#8217;s her imagination&#8230;&#8221;</i><br>
<br>
<i>I&#8217;m relieved&#8230;actually, I hope that story is true, just a little bit. </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;By the way&#8230;I&#8217;m always amazed how girls like talking about people&#8217;s love and lust.&#8221; </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/snap873.jpg" alt="" class="img" border="0"><br>
<br>
<i>My female classmates are always talking about their love lives. They
sometimes ask advice from me, who has no experience. They can ask such

<i>I hurriedly shake my head because it&#8217;s not usual for Sae to mumble like this. </i><br>

<br>
<i>Today, the teachers have a big meeting, so classes get out before
noon. Being a bit clumsy, I unintentionally tell my friends that I got
a part-time job. </i><br>

<i>Four beautiful girls and one sexy manager&#8230;It wouldn&#8217;t be wise to say this. </i><br>

<b>Ed Note: The preceding text is something you have to go through
every time you play, regardless of who you choose. I usually skip past
it because it&#8217;s so fucking dry and asinine and is in no way relevant to

<br>
<i>Because of my friend, I head for work a bit later than usual. I
start jogging towards work; it wouldn&#8217;t be wise for a new employee to
be late so soon after starting. </i><br>
<br>
<b>They wouldn&#8217;t fire you.  You&#8217;re the quotacock.</b><br>
<br>
<i>I arrive at the park close to work, and I notice I still have about
10 minutes before my shift. But I&#8217;d better get there as soon as
possible. I have work that needs to be taken care of. </i><br>
<br>
<b><i>&#8230;what</i> work?  You&#8217;re a waiter.  It&#8217;s not like you can take preemptive orders or something.</b><br>
<br>
<i>I remember my friend&#8217;s words&#8230;&#8221;So, is there any girl that you are
interested in?&#8221; I start jogging again and think to myself, &#8220;A girl I&#8217;m
interested in&#8230;&#8221;</i><br>
<br>
<i>Sae, Hiromi, Ryo, Chimaki, or Akina&#8230;They all have their unique qualities, and I&#8217;m interested in every single one of them. </i><br>
<br>
<b>&#8221;I.e.  I&#8217;m desperate as hell.&#8221;</b><br>
<br>
<i>But I look like a girl.  Is it alright for me to think this way? </i><br>
<br>
<b>&#8221;I&#8217;m not very manly looking, so is it okay for me to be horny?  Maybe I should ask the internet.&#8221;</b><br>
<br>
<i>Well, the reason I got this job was because I look like this. I
wouldn&#8217;t be suffering if I could change everything in a single day. </i><br>
<br>
&#8230;:what:<br>

<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;No, no!!  I shouldn&#8217;t think this way!!&#8221; </i><br>
<br>
<i>I shouldn&#8217;t be thinking like this before I take action!  I better think more positive!</i><br>

<br>
<b>You guys are so going to regret this.  <sub>Note: I&#8217;m not sure
whether Ryo actually won or whether Chimaki actually won because I kept
losing count. I went with Chimaki since she&#8217;s the shortest scenario and
my least favorite. Momma always said save desert for last. And no,
that&#8217;s not why Akina&#8217;s last.</sub></b><br>
<br>
<i>I can&#8217;t believe Chimaki&#8217;s older than I am. She looks a lot younger
than me. It&#8217;s going to take me a while to get used to her, but it&#8217;s
cute how I can treat her as a little sister. Although, she is older&#8230;<br>
<br>
This is a pretty complicated situation&#8230;all of them are equally good. I
mean I&#8217;m a guy, I&#8217;m really happy to work at a place like this. </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;Hmm.  Still, I don&#8217;t like it when they call me pretty boy&#8230;&#8221;</i><br>
<br>
<b>Note:  No one has actually called him that.</b><br>
<br>
<i>It&#8217;s also embarrassing to tell my friends I was hired because I look like a girl. </i><br>
<br>
<b>Then WHY are you telling them that?  My story would be &#8220;I got hired as a waiter and got three blowjobs and a couchride.&#8221;</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;Sigh&#8230;ah.&#8221; </i><br>
<br>
<i>I walk slowly and look at the clock. </i><br>

<br>
<i>I&#8217;ve been thinking too long.  It&#8217;s time to go to work!!  I run to work as fast as I can. </i><br>

Interesting thing in Japanese class yesterday:<br>
<br>
We were discussing some study done by some guy about what kind of faces
different cultures find attractive, and as far as men went Americans
found the square-shaped jaw more attractive. Japan, on the other hand,
liked the V-chin, more feminine look.<br>

No wonder our protagonist scores with the ladies. Japanese ladies apparently like feminine guys.<br>

<b>Yes, Microsoft Word, I know that &#8216;ranky&#8217; isn&#8217;t a real word.</b><br>

Those two scenes don't make a whole lot of sense and contribute nothing
but redundant character development to the overall story.<br>
<br>
Basically, Sae gets pissed at Yukari and slaps the shit out of him. Sae
forgives him. No one at the restaurant likes a cheese dish so they ask
Yukari to serve it for them. In the end, none of it is terribly
important.<!-- google_ad_section_end -->

<i>Hey, I find that offensive&#8230;</i><br>
<br>
<b>Of course, Yukari&#8217;s too dim to notice it.</b><br>

<br>
<i>However, I let out a sigh&#8230;this girl has always been straight with
me, but I think of her as family. That&#8217;s why her comments and opinions
are important to me. I don&#8217;t think she even remembers why I took the
judo class in the first place.</i><br>

<img src="1_files/sae.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;But you
sure do look more manly than before. You were such a girl boy back when
we were young, but now you&#8217;re so cute that even Akina flirted with
you.&#8221; </i><br>
<br>
<b>That doesn&#8217;t count.  Akina&#8217;s a whore.</b><br>

<br>
<i>A mistake? I want to ask her what she meant by that, however, at the
mention of my first time with Akina, my mouth won&#8217;t move right. Crap,
I&#8217;d better calm down&#8230;</i><br>

<br>
<img src="1_files/sae.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;H, hey!  You don&#8217;t have to talk about old times, you know!!!&#8221; </i><br>
<br>
<i>She remembers it very clearly&#8230;the way she gets mad and yells still hasn&#8217;t changed since she was a little kid. </i><br>

<i>She has shiny hair, cute eyes, nice lips&#8230;I quickly look away from

<i>Her anger quickly diminishes to a blush.  I too blush at what I&#8217;ve just said. </i><br>

<br>
<i>My talk with Sae wasn&#8217;t the best I&#8217;ve ever had, but it was just
something that I could only talk about with her. Is it because she&#8217;s my

<i>With most of my work finished, Akina allows me to take a breather. </i><br>
<br>
<b>The hell do you mean, &#8216;most&#8217;? You&#8217;re a waiter. If you&#8217;ve still got
tables you sure as shit better not be taking a break. That pisses me
off at restaurants. I sure hope someone&#8217;s covering for your ass because
those perverts out there may need drink refills.</b><br>
<br>
<i>Hmm, this sofa is very comfortable&#8230;I wish I had one of these at home. </i><br>

Yuka, you&#8217;re here! Hear me out! There was this one drunk guy! He kept
asking me perverted questions, like do I want to sleep with him, and he
almost touched me!!&#8221; </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</i><br>
<br>
<i>So there are people like that at this restaurant. As I guy, I&#8217;m
embarrassed. I think sexual harassment is a very low-life behavior. </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/sae.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;I was about to slap him; luckily Akina came out.&#8221; </i><br>
<br>
<i>Finally, Sae takes in a deep breath and relaxes. </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/sae.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;I&#8217;m glad she came out.  If I&#8217;d slapped him, I probably would&#8217;ve been fired&#8230;&#8221;</i><br>

<br>
<b>Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.  Your sympathy skills kind of suck shit, Yukari.</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;I&#8217;m worried, but&#8230;&#8221;</i><br>

<br>
<b>&#8221;Don&#8217;t you kind of think you deserve to be treated like a slut?&#8221;  :colbert: </b><br>

<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;I&#8217;m sure some people would get the wrong idea, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221; </i><br>
<br>
<i>I calm down as Sae calms down. I mean, customers are only human. If
the girls are wearing sexy outfits like this, some guys will get an
idea.</i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;By the way, aren&#8217;t you embarrassed wearing that?&#8221; </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/sae.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;Well&#8230;&#8221;</i><br>
<br>
<i>Sae moves awkwardly; she looks like she wants to say something, but she doesn&#8217;t know what to say. </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/sae.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;Well,
at first I was embarrassed wearing it, but I got used to it. Besides,
it&#8217;s no different than wearing a swimsuit, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221; </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a tail on a swimsuit, and I don&#8217;t think you put on bunny ears either.&#8221; </i><br>
<br>
<i>But she does have a point&#8230;</i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/sae.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;B, but it&#8217;s cute, isn&#8217;t it?  I like this uniform&#8230;&#8221;</i><br>

<img src="1_files/sae.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;Yeah&#8230;&#8221;</i><br>
<br>
<i>They way she blushes is so cute, but I wonder why she&#8217;s blushing?
Sae sure is acting really girlish right now. I jokingly say, </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;Haha, you might like the attention.&#8221; </i><br>

<i>The air in this room feels heavier.  Was I not supposed to say that? </i><br>

<i>Sae blushes, and she lets out her secret. </i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/sae.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;Remember I told you before that I might not be normal?  Well, it&#8217;s a bit different from what you think&#8230;I AM differnt.&#8221; </i><br>
<br>
<b>Yes, they misspelled different.</b><br>
<br>
<i>Remembering&#8230;Yes, she did say something about that&#8230;</i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/sae.PNG" alt="" class="img" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;Well, I get turned on what people look at me and, well, errr&#8230;&#8221;</i><br>

<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>&#8221;I think it&#8217;s the same thing with singers and actors.
They want to show their talents to other people, that&#8217;s how they feel
confident about themselves. Everyone wants to be known by someone else.
You&#8217;re just acting like a normal person would act.&#8221; </i><br>
