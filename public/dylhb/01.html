<b>Chapter One:  A Part-time Beginning</b><br>
<sub>With a suprising lack of, you know, chicks.</sub><br>

<br>
<i>I haven't felt
excited for a long time. My school is one of the most prestigious
schools in this area: both teachers and students are good. It's always
good to have many friends.</i><br>
<br>
<b>This guy sounds like a winner already.</b><br>
<br>
<i>My name is
Yukari Fujisawa. I'm a senior at Kinozaka High School. Since this
spring, I've started living by myself because my family had to move,
due to my father's job. I decided to stay here because I have school
and I want to go to college here.<br>
<br>
My hobbies are
reading, raising tropical fish, and I sometimes practice judo. My
grades are pretty good (I think...), but I don't have good reflexes. (I
can't ride a bicycle...)<br>
<br>
I'm not picky
about food. I don't hate any particular person, and I'm not hated by
anyone (I hope). I don't believe in ghosts, monsters, or those kinds of
stuff. <br>
<br>
In the future, I want to be an ordinary businessman, or I want a job that has something to do with tropical fish.</i><br>
<br>
<b>Christ, give us your whole life story please. Only about a third of
this information ever comes up again later. Tl;dr version: I LIVE
ALONE, I SOMETIMES PRACTICE MARTIAL ARTS AND I'M ABSOLUTE APESHIT FOR
TROPICAL FISH.</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>It's sad to say, but I don't look my age.  I'm not manly at all.  I guess judo hasn't helped my physique.  <img src="1_files/emot-emo.gif" alt="" border="0">  I don't think you want to know my bust, waist, or hip sizes.  However, people often ask me.</i><br>
<br>
<b>You mean like, randomly, on the street?  "Hello there!  What's your bust size?"</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>You'll say, 'how come?'  Because of my figure and feminine appearance.</i><br>
<br>
<b>Ah, the good old "look like a chick" method that anime loves so
much. All you need is martial arts training and you can get syndicated
on Adult Swim. ...wait, you've got that. I'll look up their number.</b><br>
<br>
<i>Have
I ever liked this feminine face? Never! People thought I was a girl
when I was little. My mom forced me to wear a girl's kimono for the
Seven-Five-Three Festival, boys gave me chocolate on Valentine's day,
and I've been lead to ladies restrooms or locker rooms many times.</i><br>
<br>
<b>You know, if I were Yukari, I would've totally taken advantage of
all of this. "Wait, this is the ladies changing room. Sure, yeah,
that's totally where I wanted to go!"</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>And...</i><br>
<br>
Insert fade-away to memory...<br>

<i><br>
<img src="1_files/emot-j.gif" alt="" border="0">1:  "Ha-ha-ha!  You look better in a girl's uniform than in a boy's uniform."<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-j.gif" alt="" border="0">2:  "That's right.  I'm sure you'd look good in a frilled dress."<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-iceburn.gif" alt="" border="0"><br>
<img src="1_files/emot-j.gif" alt="" border="0">1:  "I'm happy to have a friend like you, but it's difficult to see you as a boy..."<br>

<img src="1_files/emot-j.gif" alt="" border="0">2:  "Really?  I didn't know that you saw him like that."<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-j.gif" alt="" border="0">1:  "N,no...He's a very good friend."<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-j.gif" alt="" border="0">2:  "Right?  Ha-ha-ha."</i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/snap034.jpg" alt="" class="img" border="0"><br>
<br>
<b>The game does this a LOT.  Twice in a row.  Yukari has a lot to think about ALL OF THE FUCKING TIME.</b><br>
<br>
<i>I'm used to
hearing girls say things like this. However this time, it's a different
story because I like this girl...She's one of the most gorgeous girls
in our school. I know she's far beyond my reach. <img src="1_files/emot-emo.gif" alt="" border="0">  But I hope she sees me as a boy at least.</i><br>
<br>
<b>Yeah she pretty much JUST said that she didn't.</b><br>
<br>
<i>It's the beginning of summer. The sun starts to shine
strong. Looking up at the bright sky, I feel empty going home by myself.<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  "I can't argue with her, though..."<br>
<br>
I sigh and slowly walk home.</i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/snap042.jpg" alt="" class="img" border="0"><br>
<br>
<b>Welcome to the pad.  Aside from the bathroom, which we'll see later in the game. Heh heh HEHHEHHEHH<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/snap048.jpg" alt="" class="img" border="0"><br>
<br>
And this main room, there's not really much to look at.  I think it's a studio at best.</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>"I'm back."<br>
<br><i>
Nobody answers. I feel lonely. I have a big family. My little
sisters were so annoying, but I miss them now...Only three Angelfish
welcome me home. I was the one who wanted to stay here, so I can't
complain.<br>
<br>
I put down my bag and hang up my jacket.  It's too hot to go outside with a jacket.</i><br>
<br>
<b>WORDS WORDS WORDS</b><br>
<br>
<i>We'll change our uniforms to summer ones soon.  My slim figure will be even more noticable...</i><br>
<br>
<b>And then the boys will really swoon.  :swoon:</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>"Hah..."<br>
<br>
<i></i>I sit on my bed and look at the papers piled up on the floor. I
don't read them everyday. "I like to read papers, but not everyday...I
wish they would deliver papers every other day or once every three
days..."</i><br>
<br>
<b>I don't know why he chose to say that last sentence out loud.</b><br>
<br>
<i>We can always see the news on TV or through the
Internet. "However, if I stop subscribing to the paper, they'll keep
nagging me for subscriptions..." That'd be annoying. I feel tired just
thinking about it.</i><br>
<br>
<b>I'm going to toss out a wild guess here and say that Yukari's still a virgin.</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>If I were pushy like others, people wouldn't say I look like a girl...I tend to worry about people too much.  I don't think I can be a sales person.</i><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  "It's not good to think so negatively!"</i><br>
<br>
<b>That's right, Yukari!  You tell those angelfish who's boss!</b><br>
<br>
<i>I guess I'm still in shock.  I have to do something to be treated as a man.<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  "Should I start practicing judo again?  Or should I get a physical part time job?"<br>
<br>
A flier flutters down from a bundle of papers.</i><br>
<br>
<b>It's a gift from God!</b><br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  <i>"Part time job information...huh?"<br>
<br>
My parents send me enough money every month. All I want are
books and stuff for my tropical fish... However, those are not cheap.<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">: "Maybe... I should get a part time job." 
<br>
<i>I've never done it,
and I have enough time. Studying won't help me to become macho.</i>
<br>
My goals for physical labor are: 1. Train my body, 2. Save
money to buy a bigger aquarium, 3. ...I'll think about it later!<br>
<br>
<img src="1_files/emot-geno.gif" alt="" border="0">:  "This is the 'To Be A Man Project' by Yukari Fujisawa!"</i><br>
<br>
<b>I'm having flashbacks to Mulan right now.  Maybe I should just call him Ping throughout the rest of the damn story.</b><br>
<br>
<i>I'll change by the end of summer.  ....... As a result, I might get a girlfriend.  Needless to say, that's my third goal.</i><br>
<br>
<b>Next time:  An actual girl finds her way into the story!</b>
