<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Yuri--?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: Ah...thank goodness..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: You're a little early...I'm sorry I wasn't home yet! Were you waiting for a long time?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-image002.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: But I started to get really nervous when nobody answered the doorbell..."<br/>
<br/>
<b>I thought that you hated me!</b><br/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: You always could have texted me. If I had known, I would have reassured you and hurried more on my way home."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: Ah...I suppose that's true...I didn't think of that...for some reason."<br/>
<br/>
<i>It should be common sense to do that, but I decide to ignore it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>She obviously doesnt text people very often. This should not surprise you even a little bit.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Anyway...let's go inside. I see you brought a lot of stuff with you."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: That's right. And did you manage to find everything I asked you to buy as well?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Yeah, pretty much. At least, I hope I got everything right."<br/>
<br/>
<b>I also bought a bunch of Red Vines. Those werent on the list but I like candy.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: I'm sure it will be fine."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/5-image003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Phrasing?</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>The first thing she does is glance around curiously, which makes me feel anxious.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: It's so clean..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Ahaha...I cleaned it before you came over, so..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: That's very considerate of you to do."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Ah, no...I would be really embarrassed for my room to be a mess while you were here."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: Hmm...well, I do enjoy cleaning...I would have gladly helped you clean."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/emot-raise.gif" title=":raise:"/> <b>I appreciate the sentiment but that would just be weird.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: That would be even more embarrassing!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Wait, don't look in there--!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>I snatch Yuri's wrist, which was in the process of opening a desk drawer of mine.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/6-image004.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: I'm sorry...! I wasn't thinking for some reason...I was just spacing out!"<br/>
<br/>
<b>So quick recap: Yuri was just about to look through our desk. This is a stock scene, meaning she would do that even if she hated our poetry as much as Natsuki does. To say that Yuri is a weird duck would be an understatement.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: It's fine, it's fine..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>I let go of Yuri's wrist. She puts both of her hands firmly in her lap, as if making sure she's keeping track of them.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: So, um...should we...get started?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: Ah...yes..."<br/>
<br/>
<b>They sure do like pausing.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/7-image005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>This was when I realized I hadnt taken a non-obscured shot of Yuri. Her outfit is really quite nice.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: Um, I have a few things planned that you can help with...decorations and other atmospheric enhancements."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Atmospheric enhancements...?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-image006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: Mood lighting, aromatherapy candles..."<br/>
<br/>
<b>Are we doing a poetry reading or running a day spa?</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Oh, wow. I didn't know you planned on taking it that far."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: Of course. I want to help take our guests to a faraway place. Although many will stop by just out of curiosity...and for...cupcakes, I guess..."<br/>
<br/>
<b>I love that she sounds almost bitter about Natsukis cupcakes, as if she hates that people wont stop for the joy of listening to poetry alone.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: I'm determined to provide an experience that will leave them wanting more."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: That's great. It's easy to forget that you're a pretty intense person."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: Ah--Intense...?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: I guess that's the best way to put it."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: Is that...a bad thing?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: No, not at all. It's something that I like about you, actually."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: I-Is that so...? That makes me feel relieved...and kind of happy..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Yeah, no need to be so anxious. You can relax a little."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: Relax..."<br/>
<br/>
<b>What does that word mean, exactly?</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: I brought some things for relaxation. I was going to use them during the poetry event..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Oh yeah? Like what?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: Let's see..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri rummages through her bag. She pulls out a few candles and a wooden cylinder-shaped object.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/9-image007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: I planned to cover the windows in black paper and use the candles to light the room. I think that would be amazing, don't you?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Yeah, that would be really neat. What's that wooden thing, though?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: Oh, this? It's a diffuser for essential oils. How familiar are you with aromatherapy?"<br/>
<br/>
<b>I have about fifteen thirty-year old women trying to sell me that on Facebook.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Not familiar at all..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: Ah, is that so? It's one of my favorite contributors to a positive atmosphere. Depending on the oils or herbs you choose, you can change the mood of the air itself. You can even feel it permeate through your body. Relaxation, positive energy, romance, reflection...It's almost like magic."<br/>
<br/>
<b>You could have saved a bunch of money by getting a Yankee Candle instead.</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri takes the cylinder and pushes a switch on the bottom. In just a moment, a thin ray of vapor begins to spout through a small hole on the top.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Wow, that smells wonderful. What kind of mood is that one for?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: This is a Jasmine essential oil. It smells a little sweet and flowery, right?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Yeah, that's a good way to describe it."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-image008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: Jasmine enhances your emotions and helps you feel them flow through your body. You feel warmer, and your heart pounds more heavily. Don't you think that will be perfect for sharing our poems?"<br/>
<br/>
<b>What, uh, poem did you plan to be reading, Yuri?</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: It does sound suitable...but you seem to know a lot about this, so I'll trust your opinion with anything."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri smiles gently, clearly enjoying herself. She again reaches into her bag and pulls out several spools of thin ribbon.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: What are those for?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: Well...did you purchase the origami paper I asked you to get?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Yeah, I have it over here..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: We won't be using the paper for folding origami. What I'd like to do is write a different word on each paper. We'll need about a hundred of them."<br/>
<br/>
<b>Did you have any specific words in mind or?</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Oh yeah? What will those be used for?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: Well, I'm going to cut pieces of ribbon to hang from the doorway of the classroom. Then, we can fasten the paper onto the ribbons to create a doorway curtain. Wouldn't that be beautiful? It would also catch the eye of those passing by the room...it may attract some to peek inside."<br/>
<br/>
<b>I didnt realize until this update that the festival was going to be held <i>indoors</i>. That seems a little off, even for a VN.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: That's really creative! I had no idea you'd be so good at this, Yuri."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/11-image009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: Well, I suppose I do get a little intense...as you'd put it. Uhuhu."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri giggles with red cheeks. Is it just me, or is she more relaxed when it's just the two of us? Or maybe it's the excitement she feels from sharing something that she enjoys.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: Here's a marker, Mitayo. You can write any characters you want. I'll help you once I finish cutting the ribbons."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Ah, alright."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Sitting on the floor together, the two of us get to work. I carefully draw a different character on each paper, doing my best to manage my bad handwriting.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>Instructions unclear. At least one of these is a getting a dickbutt drawn on it.</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri unravels a long strand of red ribbon to her desired length. Then, she reaches into her bag once more and pulls out a pocket knife.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Eh...?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>The knife is strangely beautiful. The silver handle has an intricate pattern of waves etched into it. The blade itself is gently tinted blue.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>Its Sting!</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: That's no ordinary pocket knife...it looks really fancy."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: A-Ah...well..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Embarrassed, Yuri looks away.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: What is it?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: You're going to think it's weird..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Yuri, whatever it is, I have no reason to judge. To each their own, you know?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: If you promise you won't be weirded out..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Yeah, I promise."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: Alright..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-image010.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: They're just...so pretty...I-I can't help it! I don't know what it is...the combination of craftsmanship and feeling of danger, maybe..."<br/>
<br/>
<b>Also, I can detect when orcs are nearby with it.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: Uu, what am I saying...? Please don't think I'm weird for this..."<br/>
<br/>
<b>You like good craftsmanship. That doesnt seem weird at all?</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Ahaha."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: You're laughing at me..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: No, I'm not laughing at you. It's just funny how nervous you got about sharing. It's...well, it's an interesting thing to be into, I guess. But I think it kind of suits you."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: Suits me...?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Yeah... It's kind of intense. Ahaha. Besides, it's a really cool-looking knife, I can't deny that."<br/>
<br/>
<b>You sound like a twelve year old.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: It is, isn't it...?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri relaxes her expression once again.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: Would you like to hold it?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Sure, I'll check it out."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri carefully hands me the knife, with the handle facing me. I take it and turn it around in my hands. It feels heavy, and extremely solid. Where do you even get a knife like this...? Curious of its sharpness, I feel the point of the knife with my index finger.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Ow--!"<br/>
<br/>
<b>Oh God. You ARE a twelve year old.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/13-image011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: Why did you do that?!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: I didn't expect it to be that sharp...! I barely touched it at all."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: I-It's my fault! I should have warned you...this knife is extremely sharp...it can cut through skin like it's paper. Oh no..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>A small drop of blood trickles down the side of my finger.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>You deserved this entirely.</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri takes my hand and gives the wound a closer look.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: Ah..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>She stares at it and noticeably fidgets.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: If you're squeamish, I'll go wash it off now--A-Ah!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Without warning, Yuri puts my finger in her mouth and licks the wound. I feel her tongue curl around my finger.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/14-staredog.001.gif" title=":staredog:"/> <b>Uh.</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Startled, I instinctively pull my hand back.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: O-Oh...p-please forgive me! I wasn't thinking! I..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri lowers her head, her face burning up.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Yuri..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: That's the most embarrassing thing I've ever done...how could I do something like that?? I'm sorry, I'm sorry..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Ah..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Sure, it was a little weird, and it took me by surprise...but I guess she was just trying to help, right...?"</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>I mean, it was pretty gosh-darn weird. Unexpected from Yuri, though? Not particularly.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Yuri, I think you're overreacting a little..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: Uuuh..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>She doesn't lift her head. What if she doesn't recover from this for the rest of the afternoon?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Alright, you know what..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/15-image012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>A good life motto.</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>I take Yuri's hand and lick her index finger in return.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: Mitayo--!! D-Did you really just do that?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: N-Now we're even..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: ..."<br/>
<br/>
<b>I mean, not really considering that she probably didnt have blood on her hands. Close enough, I suppose.</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri just looks at me like I did something wrong.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Ahaha...I knew that would be a bad idea..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>If not for the sweet aroma of the Jasmine oil, the air would be extremely heavy right now.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: You're so weird, Mitayo."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri giggles shyly.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Eh...?"<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Ah...I don't think I need one, actually. It was a tiny cut. Look, it already stopped bleeding."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: I see..."<br/>
<br/>
<b>Uh, you should definitely go and clean that. Human mouths are disgusting.</b><br/>

<br/>
<i>The tension is quickly lifted. We each resume our respective activities. I watch Yuri's knife cut through the ribbon like it's nothing but air. Meanwhile, I continue to make progress on the paper. </i><br/>
<br/>
<b>I drew Spiderman on this one.</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>After we finish attaching the paper to the ribbons, we lay them all out side by side. It looks better than I expected and will be very effective as a door curtain.</i><br/>

<br/>
<b>Man, were gonna have the best Easter eggs in the club.</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Taking Yuri's advice, I decide to use small plastic bathroom cups rather than full-sized glasses. I put them on a plate to catch any paint that drips, then bring it back into my room.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Yuri?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-image015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>I come in to see Yuri quickly unrolling her sleeve, pulling it back over her arm.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Ah, nothing...your face is a little red. Is it too hot in here, or anything?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: Ah--No, not at all! There's nothing wrong, so...let's mix the paint."<br/>
<br/>
<b>She probably is hot  shes wearing long sleeves and is clearly excited by you.</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri hurriedly dismisses me and takes it upon herself to unwrap the tablets, dropping them into the cups.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: So...I thought we would do something simple that would look very nice. I'd like to paint a gradient across the banner...starting with the colors for a sunrise, then daytime, then sunset and nighttime. Once it dries, I'll write an inspirational quote across the banner. We can hang it on the wall behind the podium at the front of the classroom."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Ah, neat. What are you going to write?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: Well...It will be more fun to surprise you."<br/>
<br/>
<b>I was kidding before, but Im starting to think that she doesnt actually have a plan worked out in any way.</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri smiles at me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: If you say so..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>After rolling out the banner, Yuri and I kneel on opposite sides so we don't get in the way of each other. Yuri uses a brush and adds a few dots of different colors across the banner to serve as a color guide when we paint.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: This kind of reminds me of elementary school..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Painting on a banner with watercolors feels a lot like the art class projects we had back then. It's relaxing.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: ...Yeah. It is fun. I'm glad you feel that way, too."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri stops painting for a moment, thinking to herself.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: For me...I don't need to go out and do crazy things to have fun. In fact, I usually don't even want to. I just like when I can spend time with one other person...even if it's something simple, like reading - it doesn't even matter if we don't talk much. Just having a friend next to me makes things feel a little bit nicer. I think that's all it takes for me to be happy."<br/>
<br/>
<b>Yuri is very much an introvert  I fully understand how she feels with this.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Is that so...?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Even if Yuri and I are quite different, I can understand where she's coming from. I feel that way about things like anime and games, where simply sharing the experience with someone can make me happy.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: I think I feel the same way."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri smiles gently.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: I knew you'd understand..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri leans over the banner to grab an unused paintbrush. But I move at the same time, causing my head to bump into hers.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: S-Sorry!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri reels back, and I quickly lift my hands in surprise.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Are you hurt?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: N-No, I'm not hurt. It just startled me...that's all. Sorry, I should have asked you to get it for me..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: It's not your fault. Ah, your face..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>There are droplets of paint on Yuri's face and neck.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: Is there something on my face?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Yeah, I accidentally got paint on you..."<br/>
<br/>
<b>Wait, how? Did you have paint on YOUR face that somehow transferred over when you bonked heads?</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Sorry, it's totally my fault! I'll get a towel right away."<br/>
<br/>
<i>I rush out and fetch a small towel, then I dampen it with hot water. I return to my room and kneel back down in front of her.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Here..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>I pat down Yuri's face and neck with the towel.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Is something wrong?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: It's hot...I just didn't expect it."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Sorry...I didn't want to use cold water."<br/>
<br/>
<b>Thats smart thinking.</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Having finished, I start to retract my hand. But Yuri suddenly holds my wrist.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: Wait--"<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/22-image019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>She breathes gently, half through slightly-parted lips. What is happening...? Is it the aroma of the Jasmine oil giving me this dizzy feeling Yuri's gentle fingers, wrapped around my wrist, send a tingling sensation through my arm. And suddenly, her face seems to be much closer to mine than it was just a moment ago...</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>Maybe its blood loss.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: Ah..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri slowly pulls away.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: I-It's fine..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>The moment is over as soon as it began. Yuri picks up her brush again. But her movements seem clumsier, like she's unable to focus. I remain silent, forced to ignore the event that just transpired. I hesitantly retrieve my own brush and continue following Yuri's example.</i><br/>

<br/>
<b>Wait, where are we keeping this? Just, like, on my floor?</b><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: Well...perhaps it would be best to leave it here, then have you bring it in the morning. I can do the lettering in the classroom before our event starts. Is that okay?"<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-NewYuriCasual.png"/>: Ahaha. You say that like you're glad it's over. Was I wrong to assume that you were at least enjoying yourself a little bit?"<br/>

<b>Yeah...slicing my finger, drawing pictures on things and bonking heads together was a veritable lark.</b><br/>

<i>Yuri thinks to herself.</i><br/>

<i>Gathering all her things, Yuri seems to look a little downcast. I understand why; it sounded like she rarely gets the opportunity to spend time with friends in a relaxed environment. But that doesn't mean this is the last time it can happen...</i><br/>
