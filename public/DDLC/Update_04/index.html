<br/>
<i>Yuri seems the most experienced, so I should start with her. I can trust her opinion to be fair.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>Not entirely sure what youre basing that on but alright.</b><br/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-20171013080216_1.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>As Yuri reads the poem, I notice her eyes lighten. Yuri smiles dreamily, as if that's a rare opportunity for her. Which itself is kind of funny...after all, isn't this supposed to be a literature club?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: ...Exceptional."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Eh? What was that?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: ...? D-Did I say that out loud...?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri first covers her mouth, but then ends up covering her whole face.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: I...!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Uu... <i>(He's going to hate me...)</i>"<br/>
<br/>
<b>I have no idea why she thinks this considering her next few lines.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Um...you really didn't do anything wrong, Yuri..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Eh...? That's...I-I guess you're right...what am I getting so nervous for? A-Ahaha..."<br/>
<br/>
<b>Nervous is an understatement when it comes to Yuri. Shes like a mortified chihuahua at pretty much all times.</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri takes a breath.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: So..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/5-20171013080225_1.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Your use of imagery and metaphors indicates you've written a lot of poetry before."<br/>
<br/>
<b>I asked the internet and they told me to make you sad.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Really...? Wow, that's a huge compliment coming from you. This is actually my first time, really."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Huh...?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri stares at me blankly, then looks at my poem again.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: ...Well, I know that! I just meant...u-um..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri trails off, unable to find an excuse. She traces her finger along the words in the poem, as if breaking it down more thoroughly.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: ...Yeah. Okay. This is the reason I was able to tell. It's just that there are specific writing habits that are usually typical of new writers. And having been through that myself, I kind of learned to pick up on them. I think the most noticeable thing I recognize in new writers is that they try to make their style very deliberate. In other words, they tend to pick a writing style separate from the topic matter, and they form-fit the two together. The end result is that both the style and the expressiveness are weakened."<br/>
<br/>
<b>I dont know a lot about poetry, but this is pretty typical in all forms of writing, so shes pretty spot-on here.</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Once Yuri finds her train of thought, it's as if her demeanor totally changes. Her stammering is completely gone, and she sounds like an expert.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/6-20171013080236_1.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: There are so many different skills and techniques that go into writing even a simple poem. Not just finding them and building them, but getting them to work together is probably the most challenging part. It might take you some time, but it all comes with practice, and learning by example, and trying new things. I also hope that everyone else in the club gives you valuable feedback."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Natsuki can be a little bit biased, though..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Biased? How?"<br/>
<br/>
<b>Really, Mitayo? Have you MET Natsuki?</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: U-Um...well...never mind. I shouldn't be talking about people like that...sorry..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: It's fine."<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm not sure if Yuri is apologizing to herself, to me, or to Natsuki.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Do you mind if I read your poem now?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Please do! I'd love to share my thought process behind it..."<br/>

<b>Poem impressions: I may just have old, bad eyes or I just dont read enough cursive, but I cant read this at all. Here.</b><br/>
<br/>
<div class="bbc-block"><h4>quote:</h4><blockquote> Ghost Under the Light<br/>
<br/>
The tendrils of my hair illuminate beneath the amber glow.<br/>
Bathing.<br/>
It must be this one.<br/>
The last remaining streetlight to have withstood the test of time.<br/>
the last yet to be replaced by the sickening blue-green hue of the future.<br/>
I bathe. Calm; breathing air of the present but living in the past.<br/>
The light flickers.<br/>
I flicker back.</blockquote></div>
<br/>
<b>There we go. Anyways, I like the cadence of this poem but Yuris poetry tends to be a little too heavy-handed and gothic for my tastes. Im a Lit major, not a poetry major  and I dont particularly like most poetry, to be honest  mostly because most poems end up looking like what Yuri just wrote. No disrespect to them or her, but theyre just generally not my taste.</b><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: ...I'm sorry I have such terrible handwriting!"<br/>
<br/>
<b>Its not terrible, its actually nice. I just cant read it.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: What?? I wasn't thinking that at all..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: But it took you a long time to read..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Ah--well, I just don't read script very often...I actually think your handwriting is pretty."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Eh? That's...a relief..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Also, I liked the poem. Even though it's short, it was really descriptive."<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: I usually write longer poems..."<br/>
<br/>
<b>Shes not lying and I wish she were.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Not at all."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: I'm...really glad you like it. I'll be honest...since it's our first time sharing, I wanted to write something a little more mild. Something easy to digest, I suppose."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Are you into ghosts, Yuri?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Huhu. Actually, the story isn't about a ghost at all, Mitayo."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Really? I must have totally missed the point..."<br/>
<br/>
<b>That makes two of us.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Well, I suppose you did only glance over it, after all...but remember that poets often express their own thoughts, feelings, and experiences in their work. They usually do more than tell a simple story, or paint a picture. In this case, perhaps the subject of the poem is only being symbolically compared to a ghost. Lingering in her last remaining place of comfort, unable to let go of the past. And soon to be left with nothing..."<br/>
<br/>
<b>More than anyone else in the group  with the exception of maybe Monika  Yuri seems to know what shes talking about the most. If it werent for her crippling shyness and social anxiety, shed probably be a better fit for president of the Literature club.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: ...That's a lot more solemn, putting it that way. I hadn't even thought of that...that's impressive."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Eh? I-It's nothing, really! Yours was impressive too, so..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Nah...if anything, I could probably learn a thing or two from you."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: ...You think so?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Yeah, of course."<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<b>You dont say.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: But in the end, I enjoyed it. I'm going to keep doing my best for you, Mitayo."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Ah...me too."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: It's nothing, really...well...it makes me happy that you think that. Just remember that it won't be long before you pick up on these things, too."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Yeah, maybe you're right. I guess I'll have to keep trying."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: I'm counting on you."<br/>
<br/>
<b>Alright, Ill chalk that up as a success. Lets see if we can go two for two.</b><br/>

<br/>
<b>Hahaha, wow. Salty right out of the gate. Never change, you little viper.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: W-What?? Harsh..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: What, you expect me to believe that you actually put effort into this? Do you think Im stupid?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: I'm not a writer! Maybe it's not very good, but yeah, I did put in effort. We all start somewhere, right?" If you're still proud of the first poem <i>you</i> ever wrote, then I'd like to read it."<br/>
<br/>
<b>One of the first things I ever wrote was a Star Ocean 2 fanfiction and it is just godawful. Its still up on FF.net as mostly a message to myself on how horrible writing can be if I let it.</b><br/>

<br/>
<b>Poem impressions: I like this. Were not going to hear it because Natsuki straight up hates our poem, but Monika says that Natsukis style is similar to Shel Silverstein, and I can see it. The simplistic style helps drive home harder points then you would expect from the basic prose. I also appreciate that Natsuki writes in a script I can read easily  that cant be said about all of the girls.</b><br/>

<br/>
<b>Considering her poem, its pretty plain why she thinks that were terrible  we opted for something much heavier than her style and it very clearly did NOT suit her.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: But isn't the point of poems for people to express themselves? Your writing style wouldn't make your message any less valid."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Yes! Exactly! I like when it's easy to read, but it hits you hard. Like in this poem. Seeing everyone around you do great things can be really disheartening...so I decided to write about it."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Yeah, I understand."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: But the other nice thing about simple writing is that it puts more weight on the wordplay. Like I set up for a rhyme at the end, but then made it fall flat on purpose. It helps bring out the feeling in the last line."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: So you did...I guess more went into it than I realized."<br/>

<i>I decide to humor her with that last comment. I don't really care how old everyone is, but if Natsuki is feeling proud then I won't take that away from her.</i><br/>

It's very challenging to write like that effectively. Both allowing people to get something out of it just by feel...or letting them deeply analyze all of the nuances."<br/>

<b>The problem that can occur with Yuris writing is that it can stretch too far into pretentious, though. Not saying that shes reached that point, but its not too far off.</b><br/>

<b>Poem impressions: Monika, more than any of the other girls, tends to write long poetry that wont easily fit onto one screenshot. If my fantastic photoshop skills arent up to par, heres a slightly easier to read version.</b><br/>
<br/>
<div class="bbc-block"><h4>quote:</h4><blockquote>Hole in the Wall<br/>
<br/>
It couldn't have been me.<br/>
See, the direction the spackle protrudes.<br/>
A noisy neighbor? An angry boyfriend? I'll never know. I wasn't home.<br/>
I peer inside for a clue.<br/>
No! I can't see. I reel, blind, like a film left out in the sun.<br/>
But it's too late. My retinas.<br/>
Already scorched with a permanent copy of the meaningless image.<br/>
It's just a little hole. It wasn't too bright.<br/>
It was too deep.<br/>
Stretching forever into everything.<br/>
A hole of infinite choices.<br/>
I realize now, that I wasn't looking in.<br/>
I was looking out.<br/>
And he, on the other side, was looking in.</blockquote></div>
<br/>
<b>Anyways, I like Monikas poetry. It flows a lot more like normal language to a cadence than a regular poetry. It makes it seem more natural  more real.</b><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/23-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Sometimes when you're writing a poem - or a story - your brain gets too fixated on a specific point...if you try so hard to make it perfect, then you'll never make any progress. Just force yourself to get something down on the paper, and tidy it up later! Another way to think about it is this: If you keep your pen in the same spot for too long, you'll just get a big dark puddle of ink. So just move your hand, and go with the flow!"<br/>
