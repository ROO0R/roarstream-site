<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: If you want to say something, say it."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: S-Sorry..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Natsuki...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Hmph."<br/>
<br/>
<i>The girl with the sour attitude, whose name is apparently Natsuki, is one I don't recognize. Her small figure makes me think she's probably a first-year. She is also the one who made cupcakes, according to Sayori.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>I like that Mitayo remembers this; hes got his cupcake-shaped priorities in order.</b><br/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/5-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: You can just ignore her when she gets moody~"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Sayori says that quietly into my ears, then turns back towards the other girls. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/5-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Anyway! This is Natsuki, always full of energy. And this is Yuri, the smartest in the club!"<br/>
<br/>
<b>Yuri, huh? According to google, that means Lily. Natsuki, in contrast, comes from a mix of 'summer' and 'hope'. As an afterthought, Sayori might be a combination of small, night, and village, though that might be a huge stretch.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: D-Don't say things like that..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri, who appears comparably more mature and timid, seems to have a hard time keeping up with people like Sayori and Natsuki. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/6-20171009224550_1.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/5-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: And it sounds like you already know Monika, is that right?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/7-20171009224555_1.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: It's great to see you again, Mitayo."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Monika smiles sweetly. We do know each other - well, we rarely talked, but we were in the same class last year. Monika was probably the most popular girl in class - smart, beautiful, athletic. Basically, completely out of my league. So, having her smile at me so genuinely feels a little... </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Y-You too, Monika."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/5-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Come sit down, Mitayo! We made room for you at the table, so you can sit next to me or Monika. I'll get the cupcakes~"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Hey! I made them, I'll get them!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/5-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Sorry, I got a little too excited~"<br/>
<br/>
<b>Sayori really likes the tilde-trail off. I used to do that all the time when I was like fifteen.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Then, how about I make some tea as well?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>The girls have a few desks arranged to form a long table. As Sayori mentioned, it's been widened so that there is one space next to Monika and one space next to Sayori. Natsuki and Yuri walk over the corner of the room, where Natsuki grabs a wrapped tray and Yuri opens the closet. Still feeling awkward, I take a seat next to Sayori. Natsuki proudly marches back to the table, tray in hand. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/9-20171009224617_1.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: ...Ta-daa!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/5-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Uwooooah!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Natsuki lifts the foil off the tray to reveal a dozen white, fluffy cupcakes decorated to look like little cats. The whiskers are drawn with icing, and little pieces of chocolate were used to make ears.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/5-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: So cuuuute~!"<br/>
<br/>
<b>I want a cupcake now. It's 9:20 in the morning though.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: I had no idea you were so good at baking, Natsuki!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Ehehe. Well, you know. Just hurry and take one!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Sayori grabs one first, then Monika. I follow. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/5-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: It's delicious!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Sayori talks with her mouth full and has already managed to get icing on her face. </i><br/>
<br/>
<b>I kind of imagine Sayori as a yellow lab.</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>I turn the cupcake around in my fingers, looking for the best angle to take a bite. Natsuki is quiet. I can't help but notice her sneaking glances in my direction. Is she waiting for me to take a bite? I finally bite down. The icing is sweet and full of flavor - I wonder if she made it herself.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-20171009224658_1.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Thank you, Natsuki."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: W-Why are you thanking me? It's not like I...!"<br/>
<br/>
<i> (Haven't I heard this somewhere before...?) </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: ...Made them for you or anything."<br/>
<br/>
<b>SO TSUNDERE BAKA</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Eh? I thought you technically did. Sayori said-"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Well, maybe! But not for, y-you know, <b>you</b>! Dummy..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Alright, alright..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>I give up on Natsuki's weird logic and dismiss the conversation. </i><br/>
<br/>
<b>I've been working on a pet theory that says the the pinker someone's hair, the more likely they are to be super quirky or possibly nuts.</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri returns to the table, carrying a tea set. She carefully places a teacup in front of each of us before setting down the teapot next to the cupcake tray. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/11-20171009224722_1.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Don't worry, the teachers gave us permission. After all, doesn't a hot cup of tea help you enjoy a good book?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Ah...I-I guess..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Ehehe, don't let yourself get intimidated, Yuri's just trying to impress you."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Eh?! T-That's not..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Insulted, Yuri looks away. </i><br/>
<br/>
<b>Good lord, they're all so easily nettled.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: I meant that, you know..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: I believe you. Well, tea and reading might not be a pastime for me, but I at least enjoy tea.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: I'm glad..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri faintly smiles to herself in relief. Monika raises an eyebrow, then smiles at me. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-20171009224733_1.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Cupcakes.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Um..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>I was afraid of this question. Something tells me I shouldn't tell Monika that I was practically dragged here by Sayori. </i><br/>
<br/>
<b>Not entirely sure how 'I wanted to check out my friend's club' is an awkward statement but you do you, Mitayo.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Well, I haven't joined any clubs yet, and Sayori seemed really happy here, so..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: That's okay! Don't be embarrassed! We'll make sure you feel right at home, okay? As president of the Literature Club, it's my duty to make the club fun and exciting for everyone!"<br/>
<br/>
<b>President is kind of a lofty title when you only have four members, isn't it?</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Monika, I'm surprised. How come you decided to start your own club? You could probably be a board member for any of the major clubs. Weren't you a leader of the debate club last year?"<br/>
<br/>
<b>This seems like a weird question to me. Why start your own club? You're already super popular!</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/13-20171009224745_1.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: To be honest, I can't stand all of the politics around the major clubs. It feels like nothing but arguing about the budget and publicity and how to prepare for events...I'd much rather take something I personally enjoy and make something special out of it. And it encourages others to get into literature, then I'm fulfilling that dream!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/5-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Monika really is a great leader!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri also nods in agreement. </i><br/>
<br/>
<b>Natsuki is presumably off seething in the corner during this.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Then I'm surprised there aren't more people in the club yet. It must be hard to start a new club."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: You could put it that way. Not many people are very interested in putting out all the effort to start something brand new...especially when it's something that doesn't grab your attention, like literature."<br/>
<br/>
<b>As a English Lit major, rude.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: You have to work hard to convince people that you're both fun and worthwhile."<br/>
<br/>
<b>As an English Lit major, accurate.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: But it makes school events, like the festival, that much more important. I'm confident that we can all really grow this club before we graduate! Right, everyone?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/5-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Yeah!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: We'll do our best."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: You know it!"<br/>
<br/>
<b>Oh, welcome back to the conversation, Natsuki.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/14-20171009224835_1.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Such different girls, all interested in the same goal...Monika must have worked really hard just to find these three. Maybe that's why they were all so delighted by the idea of a new member joining. Though I still don't really know if I can keep up with their level of enthusiasm about literature... </i><br/>
<br/>
<b>At risk of spoilers, this will absolutely not be a problem.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: So, Mitayo, what kinds of things do you like to read?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Well...ah..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Considering how little I've read these past few years, I don't really have a good way of answering that.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: ...Manga..."<br/>
<br/>
<b>You were about to join the anime club, Mitayo. Stop dancing around the subject - you like anime. It's fine.</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>I mutter quietly to myself, half-joking. Natsuki's head suddenly perks up - it looks like she wants to say something, but she keeps quiet. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: N-not much of a reader, I guess..."<br/>
<br/>
<b>RUDE</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: ...Well, that can change..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>What am I saying? I spoke without thinking after seeing Yuri's sad smile. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Anyway, what about you, Yuri?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Well, let's see..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri traces the rim of her teacup with her finger. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: My favorites are usually novels that build deep and complex fantasy worlds. The level of creativity and craftsmanship behind them is amazing to me. And telling a good story in such a foreign world is equally impressive."<br/>
<br/>
<b>She's got a copy of LOTR in her backpack right now. Calling it.</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri goes on, clearly passionate about her reading. She seemed so reserved and timid since the moment I walked in, but it's obvious by the way her eyes light up that she finds her comfort in the world of books, not people. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: But you know, I like a lot of things. Stories with deep psychological elements usually immerse me as well. Isn't it amazing how a writer can so deliberately take advantage of your own lack of imagination to completely throw for you a loop? Anyway, I've been reading a lot of horror lately..."<br/>
<br/>
<b>"Mitayo, have you heard of Creepypastas?"</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Ah, I read a horror book once..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>I desperately grasp something I can relate to at the minimal level. At this rate, Yuri might as well be having a conversation with a rock. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/15-20171009224859_1.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: For someone as gentle as you..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: I guess you could say that. But if a story makes me think, or takes me to another world, then I really can't put it down. Surreal horror is often very successful at changing the way you look at the world, if only for a brief moment."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/16-20171009224907_1.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Oh, you hate lots of things.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Oh? Why's that?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Well, I just..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Natsuki's eyes dart over to me for a split second. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Never mind."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: That's right, you usually like to write about cute things, don't you, Natsuki?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: W-What? What gives you that idea?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: You left a piece of scrap paper behind last club meeting. It looked like you were working on a poem called-"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Don't say it out loud! And give that back!"<br/>
<br/>
<b>"It's a work in progress, Mom!!! It's called slash and it's ART!"</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Fine, fine~"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/5-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Ehehe, your cupcakes, your poems...everything you do is just as cute as you are~"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Sayori sidles up behind Natsuki and puts her hands on her shoulders. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/17-20171009224918_1.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>If you hate your image that much, you might want to invest in some hair dye.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Natsuki, you write your own poems?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Eh? Well, I guess sometimes. Why do you care?"<br/>
<br/>
<b>Just making conversation. Jeez.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: I think that's impressive. Why don't you share them sometime?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: N-No!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Natsuki averts her eyes. </i><br/>
<br/>
<b>I was just kidding before but I think she actually is writing weird fanfiction.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: You wouldn't...like them...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Ah...not a very confident writer yet?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: I understand how Natsuki feels. Sharing that level of writing takes me than just confidence. The truest form of writing is writing to oneself. You must be willing to open up to your readers, exposing your vulnerabilites and showing even the deepest reaches of your heart."<br/>
<br/>
<b>Alright, tone it down a little, Zenyatta.</b><br/>

<b>Yuri looks visibally uncomfortable with the idea.</b><br/>

<b>To be fair, Mitayo has a perfectly valid point and they're kind of giving him unnecessary flack here.</b><br/>

<b>So this is where the main actual gameplay is (which is a lot more than you can say for most VNs, to be fair). Our assignment is to write a poem, and we given 20 lists of assorted words that we can use. We don't get to see the completed poem, but the elements we put in will definitely affect one of the girls based on their own preferences.<br/>
<br/>
For example, on this page, Milk / Awesome / Lollipop belong to one category, Love / Peace / Promise belong to another and Melancholy / Raindrops / Climax belong to yet another. That being said, it's now time for audience participation. Knowing that your answer will increase our appeal with a certain lady, which of these series of words do you want to go with? A list of possible combinations are located below - the options are randomized, so I can't give you direct options. Some answers may or may not have similar results with multiple girls.
