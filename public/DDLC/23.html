<b>So that was, more or less, the ending of the game that most people got upon completing the game.<br/>
<br/>
However, there is a different version to unlock that requires getting all of the CGs in the game in one save file (obviously before Monika deletes/corrupts your save files in Act II). This requires reloading from day one at least three times. There are three from Natsuki, three from Yuri, three from Sayori and one from Monika. Weve seen some of them, but most need to be unlocked via the special scenes with the girls. Since you all went absolutely gung-ho with Yuri, we still have a little bit of work to do before we get that sweet 100% status.<br/>
<br/>
Lets arbitrarily start with Natsuki. Weve already seen her first scene back in Act II  the one where we were introduced to Parfait Girls. I have zero ambition to go over the changes youd see in Act I because there arent many. She doesnt get crazy death eyes and at the end she lets Mitayo borrow the book they were reading with the promise that he would finish it that night and be careful with it. There. Youre all caught up. If you desperately need a refresher, <a class="postid477637387" href="../Update%2013/">heres a link to that update.</a></b><br/>

<b>Last time on Tsundere Talk: this is the day after we read volume one of Parfair Girls with Natsuki.</b><br/><br/>
<i>It's not long before Natsuki comes up to me expectantly.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Yeah, yeah. Don't worry, I kept my promise."<br/>
<br/>
<i>I pull the first volume of Parfait Girls out from my bag. Natsuki takes it from my hands, then quickly turns it over, presumably to check for wrinkles.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Hey, I'm not that careless...I handle manga all the time, you know."<br/>
<br/>
<b>Im a professional manga wrangler. This isnt my first manga rodeo, Natsuki.</b><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Can you blame me for being paranoid? I don't give people my manga every day, you know."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: That's true...I don't blame you."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Well anyway, let me put this one back. I'm gonna get the next one, okay?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Natsuki makes her way to the closet. I follow. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/5-003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>I know Ive mentioned it before, but I just love how excited these girls get about their passions. <img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/emot-3.gif" title=":3:"/></b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Where did this volume leave off again? I forget."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Ah, the chapter ended when Minori and Alice found--"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: <i>Monika!!</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>Natsuki's voice resonates out from inside the closet. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Eh...?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>I peer inside. All of Natsuki's books are lined up on the top shelf.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Did you move my manga again?!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/6-004.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>This is from a much more innocent time, when Monika wasnt, you know, driving these girls to murder themselves.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/7-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: The teacher got mad at me for taking up so much space in her closet...so I had to move some stuff around and clean up a little bit. It's all still there, I just had to organize it a bit!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Ugh..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>The top shelf is far above Natsuki's head. She makes a futile hop, trying to figure out how to reach her manga. </i><br/>
<br/>
<b>Ha ha, youre little.<br/>
<br/>
How hard would we get elbowed if we just patted her on the head right now?</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: This is so inconvenient! I'm moving these all back down. There's plenty of room on these shelves. And besides...they're really pretty to look at when they're all lined up! Why would you waste that on the top shelf?"<br/>
<br/>
<b>Part of me wonders if Monika did this on purpose. Shes not evil, yet, but she obviously doesnt care for us hanging with Natsuki.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Ah, Natsuki...there's a stool on the wall there."<br/>
<br/>
<i>In the closet, there's a collapsible stool that's hanging on the wall. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: If you want, I can reach up there and hand them to you..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: I can get them myself!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Natsuki grabs the stool from the wall and unfolds it. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: You think Im too short or something?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: I mean--"<br/>
<br/>
<b>I like how Mitayo doesnt even bother denying it.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: I <i>knew</i> it! Well, you know what? Just watch me!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Natsuki hops onto the stool, which ends up being a little wobbly because of its collapsible design. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: A-Ah..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Careful..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: I know what I'm doing!!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Standing on the stool, Natsuki's fingertips reach the top shelf. The stool would be enough for me to easily grab the books, but Natsuki is being stubborn as usual. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: U-Uuuh..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Natsuki uses her fingers to scoot one of the smaller boxes to the edge of the shelf. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: See...? Kyah--!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>The box suddenly tips. Natsuki barely catches it before it falls to the floor. The stool wobbles.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>Monika doesnt even have to <i>do</i> anything in this timeline. Natsukis going to get herself killed all by herself.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Wawaa--"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Losing balance, Natsuki hops off the stool. Thankfully, she was able to stay on her feet. She holds the box triumphantly. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/9-007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Having almost fell, Natsuki is a bit shaken up. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Jeez...no need to prove yourself to me. There's no way you'll be able to get the bigger boxes like that. I can reach them, so just--"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: I said I can do it! I don't want your help, okay?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Sigh..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: I'm gonna get a chair, so just hang on."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Natsuki forces her way past me out of the closet. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Let's see..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>The classroom chairs have the desks attached, so they're too inconvenient to fit into the closet. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Aha!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Natsuki trots over to the teacher's desk, which has a computer chair behind it. She rolls it on its wheels back over to the closet. </i><br/>
<br/>
<b>NO. BAD IDEA.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Ah--"<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's a little dangerous, since the chair swivels and rolls. But I've already learned my lesson, so I keep my mouth shut. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Ush--"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Natsuki climbs onto the chair, then slowly balances onto her feet. Since she refuses my help, I take a seat with my back against the side of the doorway and simply watch. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>I refuse to take responsibility for this.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Aha! There we go! See? I can easily do it now."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Natsuki grabs a stack of manga and bends down to put it on the shelf below. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: W-Wahh--"<br/>
<br/>
<i>The chair swivels. Natsuki catches herself on the shelf. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: What are you doing?? Can you at least hold the chair steady instead of sitting and doing nothing?"<br/>
<br/>
<i> (Who was it who told me not to help...?) </i><br/>
<br/>
<b>If I help, that means I was complicit in this stupidity.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Yeah, yeah...I got you."<br/>
<br/>
<i>I hold the chair while Natsuki reaches back up. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: --!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>I can... </i><br/>

<br/>
<b>seriously, Mitayo? Were doing this?</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Guh--"<br/>
<br/>
<i>I force myself to turn away. Natsuki seriously didn't think this through...! Once she realizes, I'll be dead! </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Hup--"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Natsuki wraps her arms around the Parfait Girls box set, easily the largest one on the shelf. </i><br/>
<br/>
<b>Why the hell are you grabbing like fifteen books at once? Youre on a wheely chair. You shouldnt be on there anyways!</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Uu...heavy...hey, Mitayo...I-I don't think I can bend down without falling...! Hurry and take this one..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Eh? But then I have to let go of the chair..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: That's fine...! Just for a second! Hurry up..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Alright...! Let me just stand up."<br/>
<br/>
<i>I slowly release my grip from the chair. </i><br/>

BGM: Music stops abruptly.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Crash! </i><br/>
<br/>
<i>The full force of Natsuki's body against me throws me to the ground. A whole bunch of books pelt me in the face. Natsuki tries to shield herself with her own arms as her face lands straight on my chest. </i><br/>

<i>Natsuki falls silent again. I can't press her, so I can only do what I know how to do. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Alright...well, I'll help clean this up. And I'll move the rest of your manga for you."<br/>

<br/>
<i>Natsuki lowers her head and stifles another sob. I'm not sure what happened to her today, but being nice is the least I could do. The next couple minutes are silent between us as I begin gathering the scattered books. I make sure to slip them into the box in their correct order. After a little bit, Natsuki starts helping. It isn't long before we're done, and I hoist the box onto the shelf where Natsuki wanted to put it. Then, I get on the stool and quickly finish moving the rest of her books from the top shelf. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Alright--! That should do it."<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Good. Even if you weren't, I'd make you anyway. You're taking responsibility for what you said."<br/>

<i>We sit in the same spot as last time, and I open the second volume. Natsuki's mood quickly improves, laughing and pointing things out to me. She's surprisingly sharp, making note of a lot of subtle repeated jokes and background elements. In the end, I'm pretty impressed by how everything ties together in this manga. I guess Natsuki has good taste after all.<br/>

After some time, Monika gets our attention as usual, and it's time to share poems again. </i><br/>

<i>I return to my seat and slip the book into my bag. </i><br/>
