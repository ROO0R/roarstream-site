Strap in, boyos, this update's a long one.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/1-update7003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
It was a threeway tie between Yuri, Natsuki, and Monika - or at least it was until that last minute vote <img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/emot-v.gif" title=":v:"/>. Before that, the only thing you all can agree on is <i>not Sayori</i>. <img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/frown.gif" title=":("/></b><br/>

<br/>
<i>Yuri stares at the poem with a surprised expression on her face.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Do you...like it?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: "Mitayo...this one might even be better than yesterday's. How did you even pick up on this so quickly...? Just yesterday, I was telling you the kind of techniques worth practicing..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Maybe that's why...you did a good job explaining. I really wanted to try giving it more imagery."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri visibly swallows. Even her hands appear sweaty.</i><br/>

<b>There's vomit on her sweater already. Mom's spaghetti, she's nervous.</b><br/><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: It's fine, take your time..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri breathes and collects her thoughts. I know that Yuri likes to think before she speaks, so I offer that patience to her.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: "Yeah...just...being appreciated like this...I guess. It probably sounds really stupid, but seeing someone motivated by my writing...it just makes me really happy..."<br/>
<br/>
<b>I've started deleting <i>some</i> of Yuri's ellipses, but not all of them. I think there were three more sets in that last statement and it didn't flow well at all.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Are you saying you've never shared your writing before?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri nods.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Really? I don't believe it."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: "I really only write for myself...and besides..."<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Do you really think that...?"<br/>

<i>Again, Yuri nods.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: "..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri doesn't respond to that. I wonder why...</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>I mean, look at how Natsuki responded to her poem yesterday. That was a hot mess - it's no wonder Yuri's a little paranoid...writing is obviously very important to her.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Anyway...do you want to share the poem you wrote today?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: "...Yeah. I do! If it's with you..."<br/>

<b>I told you that she wasn't lying about long poems.</b><br/>
<br/>
<div class="bbc-block"><h4>quote:</h4><blockquote>The Raccoon<br/>
<br/>
It happened in the dead of night while I was slicing bread for a guilty snack.<br/>
My attention was caught by the scuttering of a raccoon outside my window.<br/>
That was, I believe, the first time I noticed my strange tendencies as an unordinary human.<br/>
I gave the raccoon a piece of bread, my subconscious well aware of the consequences.<br/>
Well aware that a raccoon that is fed will always come back for more.<br/>
The enticing beauty of my cutting knife was the symptom.<br/>
The bread, my hungry curiosity.<br/>
The raccoon, an urge.<br/>
<br/>
The moon increments its phase and reflects that much more light off of my cutting knife.<br/>
The very same light that glistens in the eyes of my raccoon friend.<br/>
I slice the bread, fresh and soft. The raccoon becomes excited.<br/>
Or perhaps I'm merely projecting my emotions onto the newly-satisfied animal.<br/>
<br/>
The raccoon has taken to following me.<br/>
You could say that we've gotten quite used to each other.<br/>
The raccoon becomes hungry more and more frequently, so my bread is always handy.<br/>
Every time I brandish my cutting knife, the raccoon shows me its excitement.<br/>
A rush of blood. Classic Pavlovian conditioning. I slice the bread.<br/>
And I feed myself again.</blockquote></div>
<br/>
<b>Poem impressions: You know, if you feed that raccoon too much, it'll lose its fear of humans and end up seriously hurting someone and that's very irresponsible. That being said, I like this poem - she seems to have lost some of her more flowery language, so perhaps yesterday's argument struck a cord with her.</b><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: "Um...I was a little more daring with this one than yesterday's..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: I can see that. It's a lot more metaphorical..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>I don't know if it's my fault, but I can't begin to imagine what this poem is about.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>It's clearly about a raccoon. Weren't you listening?</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: "That's right. It's a bit closer to my preferred writing style...using the poem as a canvas to express vivid imagery, and conveying emotions through them."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Yeah, if I take it at face value, then I can't even figure out what it's supposed to mean..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: "Well...I think it's something that different people can relate to in their own way. I wanted to express the way it feels for me to indulge in my more unusual hobbies...it's those sorts of things I'm usually forced to keep to myself. So, I sometimes enjoy writing about them."<br/>
<br/>
<b>This is an interesting topic that I can't get into at this time, so keep it tucked away for later.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Why do you keep them to yourself?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: "Be...Because...they're embarrassing...and people would make fun of me. Don't you have anything like that, Mitayo?"<br/>
<br/>
<b>Does being part of the Literature Club count?</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Well...yeah, I guess I do..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-update7014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: "The best we can do is respect each other and our individualities. Even if it's difficult sometimes, and some things make us uncomfortable...after all, if I hadn't learned to embrace my own weirdness, I would probably hate myself."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: "I-I might be ranting a little bit now...but I'm glad that you're a good listener. You're good at a lot of things...writing, listening..."<br/>
<br/>
<b>"Sensuously hand feeding me chocolate..."</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: "There really aren't many people like you, Mitayo..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Th-That's exaggerating a little bit..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: "It's just...how I feel. I never thought I would feel so comfortable sharing my writing...but now, I almost feel like I look forward to it...it's just...a really nice feeling. And you're to thank for that."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: It's...it's nothing, really..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri smiles sincerely at me. For just a moment, her timidness seems to disappear.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>At the very least, it's nice that we're able to pull Yuri out of her shell a little bit.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/11-update7002.jpg"/><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/13-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: "Well, I can admit that it's better than the last one. It's nice to see that you're putting in some effort."<br/>
<br/>
<b>That might be the nicest thing Natsuki has ever said to us.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: That's good..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/13-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: "But I still don't like this at all. It's trying too hard to be serious."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Eh? What do you mean by that?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/13-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: "Poems don't need to be all deep-sounding to express something. It's going to just sound like you're forcing it unless you really don't suck at it. Honestly... Don't bother trying to write poems like this until you're on Yuri's level--"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Natsuki stops short all of a sudden.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/14-update7006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Eh?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/13-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: "You're not...you're not just trying to impress Yuri, are you?!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: W-What are you talking about?? And keep your voice down...!"<br/>
<br/>
<b>I think she knows that we fancy her, Mitayo.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/13-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: "You know Yuri would love this kind of...this angsty.......!!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Just because she's a talented writer doesn't mean...I-I mean..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/13-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: "Uu....!!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Looks like I'm in trouble. I somehow struck a nerve, though what I did is beyond me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/15-update7007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Natsuki shoves the poem I handed her back over to me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/13-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: "Take your stupid poem. If you wrote it for someone else, just don't show it to me!"<br/>
<br/>
<b>It's entirely possible that I wrote it for the whole group!</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Ouch..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>This is what I get for letting a younger girl step into my business. Unless I was a mind reader, I was destined to be in a world of pain from the start. At least Natsuki wasn't really the girl I was trying to impress in the first place...</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>No, I didn't forget anything here. Natsuki flat-out doesn't show us her poem. To be fair, if we'd gone with group B words both times, Yuri would be just as closed-off...though she'd be a bit more mature about it.</b><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: "How's the writing going?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Alright, I guess..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: "I'll take that. As long as it's not going bad! I'm happy that you're applying yourself. Maybe soon you'll come up with a masterpiece!"<br/>
<br/>
<b>Uh, all of my works thus far have been gothic masterpieces, thank you very much.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Ahaha, I wouldn't count on that..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: "You never know! Want to share what you wrote for today?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Sure... Here you go."<br/>
<br/>
<i>I give my poem to Monika.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: "..."<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: "It feels like you're not only getting more comfortable with your style...but the imagery is better than the last one I read!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: "Just wondering, but have you been finding inspiration in Yuri's writing style?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Hmm...I guess so. You can't deny that she's talented."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: "Yeah, totally! I think her poems are the most...romantic. That's the best way to describe it."<br/>
<br/>
<b>You <i>do</i> know that she wrote about a raccoon today, right?</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: "She's like a totally different person when she picks up a pen..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: I noticed that, too. Or when she's talking about literature, it's like a light turns on inside her."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: "Mhm! Sadly, it's hard to get much personal conversation out of her..."<br/>
<br/>
<b>It's not that she has problems talking, she just has no self-confidence in anything she says or does.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/20-update7025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: "Who knows what goes on in that head of hers?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: I hope you don't mean that in a bad way."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: "No, of course not! I just meant that I wish she didn't keep so much to herself...but still, defending her like that...you must be pretty into her..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Eh?! You...completely misunderstood!"<br/>
<br/>
<b>She saw you hand-feeding her chocolate. She didn't misunderstand a thing.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: "Ahaha! Calm down, I'm kidding! Besides, I'm pretty sure she's already got a boyfriend..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Wait, really?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: "Yeah. A fictional one, anyway."<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: ...Well, there's not really anything wrong with that!"<br/>
<br/>
<b>Uh, you sure, bro? I don't think a Reginald Barclay is what you're looking for, Mitayo.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: "Oh, well I know...! I was just saying~ but anyway...you want to read my poem now? I like the way this one turned out, so I hope you do too~"<br/>

<div class="bbc-block"><h4>quote:</h4><blockquote>Bottles<br/>
<br/>
I pop off my scalp like the lid of a cookie jar.<br/>
It's the secret place where I keep all my dreams.<br/>
Little balls of sunshine, all rubbing together like a bundle of kittens.<br/>
I reach inside with my thumb and forefinger and pluck one out.<br/>
It's warm and tingly.<br/>
But there's no time to waste! I put it in a bottle to keep it safe.<br/>
And I put the bottle on the shelf with all of the other bottles.<br/>
Happy thoughts, happy thoughts, happy thoughts in bottles, all in a row.<br/>
<br/>
My collection makes me lots of friends.<br/>
Each bottle a starlight to make amends.<br/>
Sometimes my friend feels a certain way.<br/>
Down comes a bottle to save the day.<br/>
<br/>
Night after night, more dreams.<br/>
Friend after friend, more bottles.<br/>
Deeper and deeper my fingers go.<br/>
Like exploring a dark cave, discovering the secrets hiding in the nooks and crannies.<br/>
Digging and digging.<br/>
Scraping and scraping.<br/>
<br/>
I blow dust off my bottle caps.<br/>
It doesn't feel like time elapsed.<br/>
My empty shelf could use some more.<br/>
My friends look through my locked front door.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, all done. I open up, and in come my friends.<br/>
In they come, in such a hurry. Do they want my bottles that much?<br/>
I frantically pull them from the shelf, one after the other.<br/>
Holding them out to each and every friend.<br/>
Each and every bottle.<br/>
But every time I let one go, it shatters against the tile between my feet.<br/>
Happy thoughts, happy thoughts, happy thoughts in shards, all over the floor.<br/>
<br/>
They were supposed to be for my friends, my friends who aren't smiling.<br/>
They're all shouting, pleading. Something.<br/>
But all I hear is echo, echo, echo, echo, echo<br/>
Inside my head.</blockquote></div>

<b>Poem impressions: Good Lord, this one's super long. When I first played through this, I didn't pay much attention to the poems themselves since, as previously mentioned, I'm not a huge poetry fan.

<i>...It's up to me to save this situation. I'm the first to start applauding. Everyone joins me afterward, and we give Yuri the recognition she deserves. It's not that we didn't want to applaud for her. But we were caught so off-guard that we must have forgotten. As we applaud, Yuri holds the poem to her chest and rushes back into her seat.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: "Yuri, that was really good. Thank you for sharing."<br/>

<i>Sayori hops out of her chair and cheerfully walks to the podium.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/29-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: "It's a lot harder than I thought! How did you guys do it so easily?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: "Ah...try not to think of it like you're reciting to other people. Imagine you're reciting it to yourself, like in front of a mirror, or in your own head. It's your poem, so it'll come out the best that way."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/29-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: "I see, I see...okay, then..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/47-update7042.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Somehow, it feels like her soft voice was made as a perfect match. The poem isn't aimlessly cheery like Sayori is. It's serene and bittersweet. If I were to read this on paper, I probably wouldn't think much of it...but hearing it come from Sayori's voice almost gives it a whole new meaning. Maybe this is what Sayori meant when she said she likes my poems. It's like I get to reach more deeply into someone I thought I knew through and through.<br/>
<br/>
Sayori finishes, and we applaud.</i><br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/29-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: "Ehehe, even Mitayo liked it. I guess that's a good sign~"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: What does that even mean...?"<br/>
<br/>
<b>Yeah, I thought we've even told her that we've liked everything she's written so far.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: "It came out nicely, Sayori. The atmosphere of the poem fits you really nicely. But it might be that other poems wouldn't work quite as well with that kind of delivery..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/29-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: "Eh? I don't really understand..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: "In other words, I've seen poems of yours where that sort of gentle delivery wouldn't work as well. They might need a little more force behind them, depending on what you're reading..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/29-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: "Oh, I know what you mean! That's...well, I've been practicing that kind of thing...it's just embarrassing to do in front of everyone...ehehe..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: "Then next time, I'm going to make you pick a poem that challenges you a little more. We don't have much time before the festival, you know?"<br/>

<br/>
<b>As spicy as ever. She hates our poems on this route and, by proxy, us - but the funny thing is that this particular line is non-changing. Even if she likes us, she still insults us.</b><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: It's fine, it's fine. I might as well get it over with. But it's not like I have much of a selection of what to read...I'll just have to go with what I wrote for today."<br/>
<br/>
<i>I stand up and step in front of the podium. Everyone has their eyes on me, making me feel terribly awkward. I recite my poem. Since I'm not exactly confident in my own writing, it's hard to put energy into it. Despite that, once I finish, I receive applause anyway.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Sorry I'm not really as good as everyone else..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: "Don't worry about it so much. I think it's less about your abilities, and more about your lack of confidence in your writing. That's something that'll improve over time, though."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Yeah... Maybe."<br/>
<br/>
<b>Look, I only write to impress the ladies.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: "Alright, then! That just leaves you, Natsuki."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/13-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: "Yeah, yeah. I'm going."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Natsuki begrudgingly gets out of her seat and makes her way to the podium.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/13-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: "The poem is called...it's called..."<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/49-update7044.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Natsuki takes a breath. Once she starts reciting the poem, her sour attitude disappears a little. While she's still a little unenthused, her poem has a rhythm and rhyme to it. It's Natsuki's trademark style, and it works surprisingly well when spoken aloud. The words feel like they bounce up and down, as if giving life to the poem. <br/>
<br/>
Natsuki finishes, and everyone applauds. She huffs back to her seat.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: "That wasn't so bad, was it?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/13-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: "Easy for you to say...you'd better not make me do that again."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: "Ah, well...do you at least feel prepared enough to recite a poem in front of other people?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/13-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: "I mean, doing it in front of other people will be way easier! I can put on whatever face I want for other people. But when it's just my friends...it's just...embarrassing."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/29-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: "That's a surprise, Natsuki...I think it would be the other way around for me."<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-boyavatest.png"/>: Jeez...I should probably find some other poem to recite instead."<br/>
