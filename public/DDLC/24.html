<b><u>THIS IS PART TWO OF THE UPDATE</u>. If you haven't already seen Natsuki fall off of a chair, you're on the wrong update! Scroll up!</b><br/><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Alright, that was Natsuki scene number two. Next on the list and the last of todays update: Natsukis baking course. To bring you up to speed, Sayori just went home because she was upset about stuff and Monika just asked who we wanted to spend the weekend helping in preparation for the festival. We chose good ol Natsuki because we like spending the weekend with an angry imp.</b><br/>

And...and you're going to help make the event a lot more fun and welcoming. I mean, the cupcakes will probably help a lot too...but you're gonna make the atmosphere special. That'll be really important for the way that people feel during the performances. So..."<br/>

<br/>
<i>Yuri isn't the only one surprised. Monika and I are also taken aback by Natsuki's words. Natsuki, of all people, to be saying such encouraging things. But I begin to understand. Natsuki was trying to sound like Sayori. Even if it didn't work perfectly, I can tell that she tried to say something Sayori would say at a time like this. Because Sayori always helps everyone smile and feel good about themselves. </i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Okay, but I'm staying here a bit longer. I barely got to do any reading today, so..."<br/>

<br/>
<b>Unlike Yuri, Natsuki probably doesnt have our address memorized in advance.</b><br/>

<i>I don't know what I was expecting, but seeing Natsuki in something other than her school uniform totally threw me off. Seeing her in such cute clothes makes the uniform seem totally unfitting in comparison. </i><br/>
