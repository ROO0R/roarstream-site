<b>So I decided to go with column B since the majority of the votes were looking for a more light option after the tragedy with Sayori, even though C technically won by one vote. Captain's prerogative. Besides, this'll give us an entirely new cutscene instead of just a slightly modified version of one that we've already seen. I can absolutely not be assed to remember which words I used, but they ARE in the video at the end of the update if youre interested.<br/>
<br/>
Natsuki's super-slow jumping isn't a glitch and I have no idea why it's showing up that way. This gif just doesn't want to work for some reason.</b><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: "Nah, don't worry. This might be a little strange for me, but I at least keep my word."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Well, I'm back at the Literature Club. I was the last to come in, so everyone else is already hanging out.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>Not everyone. <img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/frown.gif" title=":("/></b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-tINKTIj.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/5-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: I hope this isn't too overwhelming of a commitment for you. Making you dive headfirst into literature when you're not accustomed to it..."<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-image4184.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Uh, Monika, youre kinda blockin the text here, Honey.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Natsuki, you certainly have a big mouth for someone who keeps her manga collection in the clubroom."<br/>
<br/>
<b>This is a slightly more abrupt response than the last time we saw this scene.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/7-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: M-M-M...!!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Natsuki finds herself stuck between saying "Monika" and "Manga".</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/7-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Manga is literature!!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Swiftly defeated, Natsuki plops back into her seat.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/5-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: I'm sorry, Mitayo...we'll make sure to put your comfort first, okay?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri shoots Natsuki with a disappointed glance.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/5-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Um, anyway...now that you're in the club and all...perhaps you might have interest in picking up a book to read?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: "Well...I can't really say no either way. Like you said, I'm in this club now. So it only feels right for me to do something like that, if you ask."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/5-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: W-Wait...I didn't mean it like that! Uu...if you don't really want to, then forget I said anything, I guess..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: "Ah--No, it's not that, Yuri. I want to try to be a part of this club. So even if I don't read often, I'd be happy to pick up a book if you wanted me to."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/5-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: A-Are you sure...? I just felt like...well, as Vice President and all...that I should help you get started on something you might like."<br/>
<br/>
<b>I love that Yuri brings up that she's vice president at literally every opportunity.</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri reaches into her bag and pulls out a book.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/5-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: I didn't want you to feel left out...so I picked out a book that I thought you might enjoy. It's a short read, so it should keep your attention, even if you don't usually read. And we could, you know"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/9-image0001.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>The only sad part about us not going with Yuri this route is that the book Yuri gives us is DRASTICALLY different. We'll go over that in a future update.</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Th-This is...how is this girl accidentally being so cute? She even picked out a book she thinks I'll like, despite me not reading much...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: "Yuri, thank you! I'll definitely read this!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>I enthusiastically take the book.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/5-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Phew...well, you can read it at your own pace. I look forward to hearing what you think."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Now that everyone's settled in, I expected Monika to kick off some scheduled activities for the club. But that doesn't seem to be the case. Yuri's face is already buried in a book. I can't help but notice her intense expression, like she was waiting for this chance. Meanwhile, Natsuki is rummaging around in the closet.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>There's a small but significant difference here - literally none of them seem interested in the others. At least when Sayori was here, there was SOME chatter; now, though, they're all focused on their own things entirely. This club is in shambles.</b><br/>
<br/>
-----<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-image0002.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>I am a firm, card-carrying member of Team Natsuki so I can't say how happy I am to be going through this...even with the game issues. <img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/emot-shobon.gif" title=":shobon:"/></b><br/>
<br/>
<i>I hear Natsuki utter an exasperated sigh from within the closet. She seems to be annoyed by something. I approach her, in case she needs a hand.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/11-image0003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Eeeesh. Not even Natsukis scenario is safe from the code glitching.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/7-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: She never puts my stuff back in the right spot! What's the point in keeping your collection organized if someone else is just gonna mess it up?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Natsuki slides a bunch of stacked books and boxes across the shelf.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: "Manga..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/7-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: You read manga, right?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: "Ah--...Sometimes..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-LfwCFX2.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Manga is one of those things where you can't admit you're really into it until you figure out where the other person stands.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: "...How did you know, anyway?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/7-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: I heard you bring it up at some point. Besides, it's kind of written on your face."<br/>
<br/>
<i>What's that supposed to mean...?</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>It means you look like an otaku. Coming from Natsuki, take it as a compliment.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: "I-I see..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>There's a lone volume of manga amidst a stack of various books on the side of one of the shelves.Curious, I pull it out of the stack.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/7-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: <i>There</i> it is!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Natsuki snatches it out of my hand. She then turns to a box of manga and slips the volume right into the middle of the rest.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/13-image0003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/7-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Seeing a box set with one book missing is probably the most irritating sight in the world."<br/>
<br/>
<b>I can see where she's coming from. I have two full complete sets of a manga and two editions of one of those sets were from a different printing and it looked out of place and awful. I spent actual money to replace them because it bothered me so much.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: "I know that feel..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>I get a closer look at the box set she's admiring.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: "Parfait Girls...?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's a series I've never heard of in my life. That probably means it's either way out of my demographic, or it's simply terrible.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>No, Parfait Girls is not a real thing. It sounds completely believable, though.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/7-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: If you're gonna judge, you can go do it through the glass on that door."<br/>
<br/>
<i>She points to the classroom door.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: "H-Hey, I wasn't judging anything...! I didn't even say anything."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/7-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: It was the tone of your voice. But I'll tell you one thing, Mitayo."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/7-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Consider this a lesson straight from the Literature Club:"<br/>
<br/>

<i>Natsuki pulls out the first volume of Parfait Girls from the box.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/7-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: I'm gonna show you exactly why!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>She shoves the book right into my hands.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: "Ah..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>I stare at the cover. It features four girls in colorful attire striking animated feminine poses. It's...exceedingly "moe".</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>Oh boy. <img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/rolleyes.gif" title=":rolleyes:"/></b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/7-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Don't just stand there!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: "Uwa--"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Natsuki grabs my arm and pulls me out of the closet. She then takes a seat against the wall, beneath the windowsills. She pats on the ground next to her, signaling me to sit there.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: "Wouldn't chairs be more comfortable...?"<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/7-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: We can't read at the same time like that."<br/>
<br/>
<b>I'm starting to wonder if the dev didn't just really like the work he did on the classroom floor.<br/>
<br/>
Also, what is it with you girls and reading the same book at the same time? You have a whole collection of books! Pick a different one!</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: "Eh? Why's that? Ah...I guess it's easier to be close together like this..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/16-image0004.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Natsuki crosses her arms and scootches an inch away from me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>So tsundere. A nice change of pace from gothic Yuri and...Sayori... <img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/frown.gif" title=":("/> </b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: "Sorry..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>I didn't exactly expect to be sitting this close to her, either...not that I can say it's a particularly bad thing. I open the book. It's only a few seconds before Natsuki once again inches closer, reclaiming the additional space while she hopes I won't notice. I can feel her peering over my shoulder, much more eager to begin reading than I am.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/7-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Wow, how long has it been since I read the beginning...?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: "Hm? You don't go back and flip through the older volumes every now and then?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/7-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Not really. Maybe sometimes after I've already finished the series."<br/>
<br/>
<b>Yeah, you don't generally need to do a reread when you're actually reading the series for the first time, Mitayo.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/7-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Hey, are you paying attention?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: "Uh..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>I am, but nothing's really happened yet, so I can talk at the same time. It looks like it's about a bunch of friends in high school. Typical slice-of-life affair. I kind of grew out of these, since it's rare for the writing to be entertaining enough to make up for the lack of plot.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>I unironically love slice of life anime. I don't watch or read that much in general, to be honest, but that's generally the genre I go with.</b><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: "If you say so...I guess it's fun sharing something you like with someone else. I always get excited when I convince any of my friends to pick up a series I enjoy."<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/7-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Hmph. Like I could ever get my friends to read this...they just think manga is for kids. I can't even bring it up without them being all like...'Eh? You still haven't grown out of that yet?' Makes me want to punch them in the face..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: "Urgh, I know those kinds of people...honestly, it takes a lot of effort to find friends who don't judge, much less friends who are also into it...I'm already kind of a loser, so I guess I gravitated toward the other losers over time. But it's probably harder for someone like you..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/7-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Hm. Yeah, that's pretty accurate."<br/>

<b>The part where you're a huge nerd loser, probably.<br/>
