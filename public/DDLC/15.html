<i>I've gotten a little more comfortable here over the past couple days. Entering the clubroom, the usual scene greets me.</i><br/>

<br/>
<b>Starting the fun off early, huh?<br/>
<br/>
Some of these glitches happen randomly and aren't in the raw video. I had to rerecord several times.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: "Ah, hi Yuri..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm not sure if it's me, or if it's Yuri's expression...but the weight of yesterday's quarrel still hangs in the air a little.</i><br/>

<br/>
<b>The glitching stops at this point and her portrait returns to normal.</b><br/><br/>
<i>Yuri glances over her shoulder, looking around the room. Natsuki is reading manga at a desk. And surprisingly, Monika isn't here yet. Suddenly, Yuri takes my arm and pulls me to the corner of the room.</i><br/>

Not just me, but Natsuki as well..."<br/>
<br/>
<b>We've been through a lot with Yuri and I feel like we know her fairly well, but remember that this is THIS Mitayo's third day of knowing her, if that.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: "Yuri...I'm happy that you were considerate and apologized. You don't have to worry too much. Even though I've only been here a couple days, I could tell something was off yesterday...maybe we were just a little extra sensitive because it was our first time sharing poems."<br/>
<br/>
<b>"Poems also swing me into a near-murderous rage, don't beat yourself up."</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: "But whatever it was...it didn't make me think any less of you. I had already decided that there's no way you can be a bad person. And now that you're apologizing, I know you really didn't mean it."<br/>

I'm really glad that you're such an understanding person...and I'm really glad that you joined this club. Everything is a little bit brighter with you around, and--"<br/>

<b>Yuri apparently wasn't ready for a Natsuki confrontation this morning.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: "No, I haven't...I was also kind of wondering where she was."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Man...Yuri, I'm guessing you haven't, either?"<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/6-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: U-Um...Natsuki, about yesterday...I-I just wanted to apologize! I promise I didn't mean any of the things I said! And I'll do my best to stay under control from now on...So--"<br/>

<b>She really did forget all about it. It's not like I'm not suprised, it's just...Monika was right, after all!</b><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/6-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: N-No, not at all...! I don't hate you..."<br/>

<div class="bbc-block"><h4>quote:</h4><blockquote>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Yuri, you really apologize a lot, don't you?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/6-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: I...I do? I don't really mean to..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/6-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Sorry...I mean--!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Ahaha. Here, this should work, right?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>I slide my desk until it's up against Yuri's, then hold my book more between the two of them.</i><br/>
<br/>
<a href="assets/images/28-20171011190046_1.jpg"><img alt="" border="0" class="timg" src="assets/images/th-28-20171011190046_1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/6-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Ah...I suppose so..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri timidly closes her own copy. Once we each lean in a little bit, our shoulders are almost touching. It feels like my left arm is in the way, so instead I use my right hand to hold the book open.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Ah, I guess that makes it kind of difficult to turn the page..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/6-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Here..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri takes her left arm and holds the left side of the book between her thumb and forefinger.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Ah..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>I do the same with my right arm, on the right side of the book. That way, I turn a page, and Yuri slides it under her thumb after it flips to her side. But in holding it like this...we're huddled even closer together than before.<br/>
<br/>
It's actually kind of distracting me...! It's as if I can feel the warmth of Yuri's face, and she's in the corner of my vision...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/6-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: ...Are you ready?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Eh?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/6-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: To turn the page..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Ah...sorry! I think I got a bit distracted for a second..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>I glance over at Yuri's face again, and our eyes meet. I don't know how I'll be able to keep up with her...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/6-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Ah...that's okay. You're not as used to reading, right?<br/>
<br/>
<a href="assets/images/29-20171011190059_1.jpg"><img alt="" border="0" class="timg" src="assets/images/th-29-20171011190059_1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/6-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: It's probably the least I can do since you've been so patient with me..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Y-Yeah...thanks."<br/>
<br/>
<i>We continue reading. Yuri no longer asks me if I'm ready to turn the page; instead, I just assume that she finishes the page before me, so I turn it by my own volition. We continue the first chapter in silence. Even so, turning each page almost feels like an intimate exchange... my thumb gently letting go of the page, letting it flutter over to her side as she catches it under her own thumb.</i><br/>

<br/>
<b>The last time we went this, Yuri seemed mildly unhappy at the thought. This time, though, she is vehemently opposed to the comparison that Mitayo's making.</b><br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<b>This seems like a fair reaction given what we know about this timeline's version of the book.</b><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/6-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Eh--?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri's been a little fidgety ever since we started reading...</i><br/>

<br/>
<b>Let's be honest here. Everyone's acting a little strange.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/14-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: So you don't know anything..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: "Sorry, I can't say I do. Are you worried about her?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/14-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Oh...no, not really. I was just making sure that you didn't do anything to her."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: "N-No, nothing!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/14-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Ahaha, don't worry...I believe you, silly. Yuri just does this sometimes, so it's nothing alarming."<br/>

<br/>

<i>I stand up. I make a mental note of where I left off in the book, then slip it back into my bag.</i><br/>

<b>Well, since Yuri's off getting the world's longest drink of water, our options are somewhat limited...<br/>
