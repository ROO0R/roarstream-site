I don't know how else to bring this up. But there's been something I've been worried about. Yuri has been acting kind of strange lately. You've only been here a few days, so you may not know what I mean. But she's not normally like this. She's always been quiet and polite and attentive...things like that.<br/>
<br/>
Okay... This is really embarrassing, but I'm forcing myself to suck it up. The truth is, I'm REALLY worried about her. But if I try talking to her, she'll just get mad at me again. I don't know what to do. I think you're the only person that she'll listen to. I don't know why. But please try to do something. Maybe you can convince her to talk to a therapist.<br/>
<br/>
I've always wanted to try being better friends with Yuri, and it really hurts me to see this happening. I know I'm going to hate myself later for admitting that, but right now I don't care. I just feel so helpless. So please see if you can do something to help. I don't want anything bad to happen to her. I'll make you cupcakes if I have to. Just please try to do something.<br/>
<br/>
As for Monika... I don't know why, but she's been really dismissive about this. It's like she just wants us to ignore it. So I'm mad at her right now, and that's why I'm coming to you about this. DON'T LET HER KNOW I WROTE THIS!!!! Just pretend like I gave you a really good poem, okay? I'm counting on you. Thanks for reading.<br/>
</blockquote></div>
<br/>
<b>Poem impressions: Man, she's really decided to go freeform on this one.<br/>
<br/>
This 'poem' is one of the reasons I really like Natsuki. She's the only person in this club who seems to realize - and care - that something is really, really wrong. Unlike ol' Mitayo, here, she at least is trying to do something about it. I especially like the 'I'll make you cupcakes if I have to' line - she's desperate to do anything to help, and she knows where her strengths lie.</b><br/>
