<br/>
<b>We're on the home stretch, boyos. We'll be getting the last three CGs in this update, which will unlock the 100% ending. We'll cover that next update, along with a few odds and ends, and then the game will be pretty much complete for this LP! That, however, is for tomorrow - today, let's focus on our best friend, Sayori. To bring you up to speed, this is the second day of the club and we just wrote a killer poem that appeals to her.</b><br/><br/>
<i>It looks like no one wants to be bothered today. I slump down into the nearest desk. How am I supposed to occupy myself with something literature-related by myself like this? I guess I could always read some of the book Yuri gave me...but I'm feeling a little too tired to read. I could probably fall asleep right now. I close my eyes and end up listening in on Sayori's conversation with Monika.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-002.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>I think that you're going to be more cool than the anime club regardless, so you have that going for you.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Hmm...well, we can't give up. The festival is our chance to show everyone what literature is all about! The problem is that the idea of a literature club sounds too dense and intellectual...but it's not like that at all, you know? We just need a way of showing that to everyone...something that speaks to their creative minds."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Mmmmmmmmmmm.....that doesn't solve the problem, though!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Eh? What do you mean?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Even if we come up with the most fun thing ever...nobody will come in the first place if it's a literature event. So it's more important to figure out how to get people to show up in the first place, you know? And after they come, we can do the thing to speak to their creative minds."<br/>
<br/>
<i>...What's this? Sayori is taking this really seriously. It's rare to hear her deliberating like this.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Huh, that's a good point...in that case, do you think food will do the trick?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: W-What kind?!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Ah... Well, I guess we could--"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/5-003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Ahaha. Good thinking. Natsuki would love to do that."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Ah! You're right! Natsuki makes the best cupcakes! That works out perfectly~"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: That wasn't why you suggested it...?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/6-004.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: ...cupcakes it is, then."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: I'm hungry..."<br/>
<br/>
<b>I love this. Sayori wasn't really thinking about what would be most efficient to cater to the group's talents. She just wanted cupcakes.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Anyway, we still need to work out the details of the event itself..."<br/>
<br/>
<b>The screen fades to black as Mitayo supposedly shuts his eyes.</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>I find myself smiling. In the end, Sayori is still her usual self. But therein lies the unexpected reason I admire her. Unlike me, who has trouble finding any motivation at all...Sayori can put her mind to things and make them come to life. I suppose that's why I end up letting her get on my case about things. I can't help but wonder what it would be like to see the world through her eyes...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/7-005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-boyavatest.png"/>: "Uwaa--!"<br/>
<br/>
<b>Does no one in this club understand personal space? I mean, Sayori gets a pass considering best friend status, I guess...but still!</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>I open my eyes to find Sayori's face filling my vision. I nearly fall out of my chair.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Ehehe, sorry~ Wait! Actually, I'm not sorry at all! It's your fault for sleeping like that! This isn't the napping club!"<br/>
<br/>
<b>Well, let me know when we start the literature, then. Mitayo's sleepy.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-boyavatest.png"/>: "Does our school have a napping club...?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: You're staying up late again, aren't you? Now that you're in a club, you're gonna have less time for anime, you know! You'll need to get used to it!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-boyavatest.png"/>: "Don't say that so loud...!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>I glance over my shoulder to see if Monika overheard.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>Oh Gee I sure hope she doesn't find out that I'm into anime that would be so embarrassing. <img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/emot-ohdear.png" title=":ohdear:"/></b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: It's true, though..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-boyavatest.png"/>: "Yeah...I know, I know. You're always looking out for me, Sayori."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/9-006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: It's what I do best!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-boyavatest.png"/>: "...That's a problem! What about you? You look out for me better than you look out for yourself. You're still oversleeping every day, aren't you?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Eh? N-Not every day!"<br/>
<br/>
<b>This is extra enlightening considering what we know about her.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-boyavatest.png"/>: "That's not very convincing...how many days this past week have you gotten up on time?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-boyavatest.png"/>: "I knew it..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: C'monnnn! At least give me the benefit of the doubt..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-boyavatest.png"/>: "I can't even do that. Look, Sayori, it's written all over you."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Eh...?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Sayori glances around at herself.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: How is it written all over me?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-boyavatest.png"/>: "You were clearly in a rush this morning...look, your hair is sticking out all around here."<br/>
<br/>
<b>And here and here and here and...just...all of this. *points to entire head*</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Ah--"<br/>
<br/>
<i>I run my fingertips down the side of Sayori's hair, trying to straighten it out.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-boyavatest.png"/>: "Man, you really need a brush for this..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: My hair is just really hard to get right..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-boyavatest.png"/>: "I won't fall for that. There's more than just your hair. Look, your bow isn't straight, either. And there's a toothpaste stain on your collar right here."<br/>
<br/>
<i>I try to wipe off the stain with my finger.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: B-But nobody would ever notice that..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-boyavatest.png"/>: "Of course they would. Nobody's gonna tell you about it because they don't want to embarrass you. Fortunately, I really don't care about that."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Hey, you meanie..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-boyavatest.png"/>: "And you don't even keep your blazer buttoned up. Seriously, Sayori...why do you think you don't have a boyfriend yet?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Eh??"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/11-008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-boyavatest.png"/>: "Sorry, but you'll thank me later..."<br/>
<br/>
<b>This whole scene just has to be flat-out torture for Sayori. Mitayo doesn't know anything about what's going on in her head and he's inadvertently hitting all of the triggers.</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>I start to button her blazer from the bottom.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-boyavatest.png"/>: "Once you see how much better it looks, you'll change your mind."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>The perspective of this CG messes with my head.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Eheheh~ This is so funny."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-boyavatest.png"/>: "What is?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Well...I was just thinking how weird it is to have a friend who does these kinds of things."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-boyavatest.png"/>: "Eh? D-Don't say that! You'll make <i>me</i> feel weird about it, stupid..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: It's okay, though. I'm happy we're like this. Aren't you?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-boyavatest.png"/>: "Ah-- I-I guess..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Hey, be careful...the button might come off!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-boyavatest.png"/>: "Why is this one so hard to close...?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>I struggle to fully close the button near her chest.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-boyavatest.png"/>: "Does this thing even fit you properly?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Ehehe~"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/13-010.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-boyavatest.png"/>: "Sigh...if you ever buttoned it, you would have noticed sooner that it doesn't fit you anymore."<br/>
<br/>
<b>I had never noticed that Sayori was practically dissheveled compared to the other girls until I saw this scene for the first time.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-boyavatest.png"/>: "What are you smiling about?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: It means my boobs got bigger again!"<br/>
<br/>
<b>Is this a real thing? Is this something you would say aloud to an unattached male friend, particularly one that you have a crush on?</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-boyavatest.png"/>: "D-Don't say that out loud!!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Ehehe~"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-boyavatest.png"/>: "Anyway...you look much better now, so...ah..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>...Why does it feel strange to see Sayori's blazer buttoned up like that?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: But it's so stuffy...uuu...it's not worth it at all!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Sayori hastily unbuttons her blazer once more.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/14-011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: That's so much better~"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Sayori puts her arms out and twirls around.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: So if I keep it unbuttoned then I won't get a boyfriend, right?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-boyavatest.png"/>: "What kind of logic is that? And why are you saying that like it's a good thing?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Because...if I had a boyfriend, then he wouldn't even let you do things like this! And you take care of me better than anyone else would, anyway...so that's why I'm keeping it unbuttoned!"<br/>
<br/>
<b>Definately not a subtle 'it could be you' vibe here.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-boyavatest.png"/>: "Stop saying all these embarrassing things!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Eh? I didn't say anything embarrassing..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-boyavatest.png"/>: "Jeez...well anyway, just focus on trying to wake up a little earlier..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Only if you focus on going to bed earlier!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-boyavatest.png"/>: "Fine, fine...it's a deal."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Ehehe~ I guess we really are better at taking care of each other than we are at taking care of ourselves."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-boyavatest.png"/>: "Yeah, I guess so, huh..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: So maybe you should come wake me up in the morning!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-boyavatest.png"/>: "You're doing it again, Sayori..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Aw, but I was joking that time!"<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>Monika suddenly calls out.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>I say that, but in reality, I've never felt more uncertain when it comes to Sayori. I know that I love her, and she loves me. But I'm having as much trouble understanding Sayori's feelings as she is. Even though I can comfort her...I keep wondering if I should be doing something more, or something different. I know these thoughts will continue to plague me until things are back to the way they were. Is that what Sayori meant by not wanting anything to change?<br/>
<br/>
I don't know. But I know that I'll give it everything I've got. Sayori is the most important person to me.</i><br/>

<b>As you might imagine, this route not save Sayori. Instead of saying that we shouldn't have rejected her, Mitayo blames himself for confessing love to her, saying that that wasn't what she needed right there and then. There is no saving Sayori...in this timeline, anyways.<br/>
<br/>
ANYWAYS that's all that. We've collected all the CGs, so next time - odds, ends, and the grand conclusion<sub><sub>ish</sub></sub> of Doki Doki Literature Club!</b>
