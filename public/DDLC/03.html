<b>You gave me cupcakes. You're never getting rid of me now.</b><br/>

<br/>
<b>Nanaki is the traditional tsundare character and she just loves getting on everyone's case. This is probably due to her age, though there might be a little Napoleon syndrome going on as well.I can't help but admire her spunk, though she does lay it on a little thick at times.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Natsuki, you certainly have a big mouth for someone who keeps her manga collection in the clubroom."<br/>

<i>Swiftly defeated, Natsuki plops back into her seat.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Don't worry, guys~ Mitayo always gives it his best as long as he's having fun. He helps me with busywork without me even asking. Like cooking, cleaning my room..."<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Sayori, that's because your room is so messy it's distracting. And you almost set your house on fire once."<br/>

<b>Spit it out, Yuki.</b><br/>

<br/>
<i>I guess that means it's up to me to rescue this situation...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Hey, don't worry about it. First of all, I wasn't expecting anything in the first place. So any nice gesture from you is a pleasant surprise. It'll make me happy no matter what."<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Yeah. I won't make it a big deal if you don't want it to be."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Alright...well, here."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri reaches into her bag and pulls out a book.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: I didn't want you to feel left out...so I picked out a book that I thought you might enjoy. It's a short read, so it should keep your attention, even if you don't usually read."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: And we could, you know...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-20171011185651_1.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>This is Steven King, isn't it? I'm gonna wager that it's a copy of Kujo.<br/>
<br/>
As an aside, this game loves ellipses but Yuri is - hands down - the worst offender.</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Th-This is...how is this girl accidentally being so cute? She even picked out a book she thinks I'll like, despite me not reading much...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Yuri, thank you! I'll definitely read this!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>I enthusiastically take the book.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Phew...well, you can read it at your own pace. I look forward to hearing what you think."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Now that everyone's settled in, I expected Monika to kick off some scheduled activities for the club. But that doesn't seem to be the case. Sayori and Monika are having a cheery conversation in the corner. Yuri's face is already buried in a book. I can't help but notice her intense expression, like she was waiting for this chance. Meanwhile, Natsuki is rummaging around in the closet.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>I'll be the first to say that I don't know what these clubs generally <i>do</i>, but it seems like Yuri is the only one actively pursuing any sort of literature. If anyone audits this group to find out whether or not they DO what they say they do, theyre all in trouble.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/13-20171011185712_1.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>But at the same time, I would feel bad for distracting her from reading. I catch a glimpse of the cover of her book. It looks like the same book that she lent to me...more than that, she seems to be on the first few pages.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>This sort of tampers down the gift a little bit. She got us a book that she <i>thinks</i> we might read, sure, but it's closer to being a book she just plain likes and hopes that we will too. Maybe I'm just being cynical, though.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Ah..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Crap--I think she noticed me looking at her...she sneaks another glance at me, and our eyes meet for a split second.</i><br/>

<b>Is this second grade? What are we doing here, exactly? You're teenagers. Act like it.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Sorry...I was just spacing out..."<br/>

<i>I mutter this, sensing I made her uncomfortable.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Oh...It's fine. If I was focused, then I probably wouldn't have noticed in the first place. But I'm just re-reading a bit of this, so..."<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: That's the book that you gave me, right?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Mhm. I wanted to re-read some of it.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Ah...well, when I stopped at the bookstore yesterday--"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Ah, that's not what I meant...I mean--I...just happened to buy two of them."<br/>

<b>A perfectly normal thing to do.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Ah, I see."<br/>
<br/>
<i>There's something fairly obvious here that Yuri isn't telling me, but I decide to let it go.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: I'll definitely start reading it soon!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: I'm glad to hear...once it starts to pick up, you might have a hard time putting it down. It's a very engaging and relatable story."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Is that so...? What's it about, anyway?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Well...mmm..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri closes the book and scans her eyes over the back. The book is titled "<u>Portrait of Markov</u>". There's an ominous-looking eye symbol on the front cover.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Alright...I just wanted to make sure I don't accidentally give anything away."<br/>

<br/>
<b>As far as I can tell from a semi-thorough Google/Amazon search, this book does not actually exist.</b><br/>

<i>That's kind of dark, isn't it? Yuri made it sound like it was going to be a nice story, so that dark turn came from nowhere.</i><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Are you not a fan of that sort of thing, Mitayo?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: No, it's not that...I mean, I can definitely enjoy those kinds of stories, so don't worry."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: I hope so..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yeah... I totally forgot that Yuri is into those things. She's so shy and reclusive on the outside, but her mind seems to be completely different.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: It's just that those kinds of stories...they challenge you to look at life from a strange new perspective. When horrible things happen not just because someone wants to be evil, but because they have their own goals, or their own philosophy that they believe in. Then suddenly, when you thought you related to the protagonist...they're made out to be the naive one for letting their one-sided morals interfere with the villain's plans."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: I'm...I'm rambling, aren't I...?"<br/>
<br/>
<b>You are a little bit because I'm not following. I mean, I kind of get what she's talking about with the pursuing ideas from an opposing angle thing, but I'm not sure how that relates to the story she described.</b><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Hey, don't apologize...! I haven't lost interest or anything."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Well...I guess it's alright, then. But I feel like I should let you know that I have this problem...when I let things like books and writing fill my thoughts..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: I kind of forget to pay attention to other people...so I'm sorry if I end up saying something strange! And please stop me if I start talking too much!"<br/>
<br/>
<b>I remember reading once that one of the worst things you can do is to shut someone down when they're genuinely excited about something. You can just <i>see</i> the enthusiasm wither away and it's awful to watch.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: That's--I really don't think you need to worry...that just means you're passionate about reading. The least I can do is listen. It's a literature club, after all..."<br/>

<b>This is a snuff book, isn't it? That's why it doesn't supposedly exist and why you're suddenly apprehensive about us reading it together.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Let me just get the book..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>I quickly retrieve the book that I had put into my bag.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Alright...it's fine if I sit here, right?"<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: That's...I'm sorry...it's not that I don't want you to! It's just something I'm not very used to...that is, reading in company with someone."<br/>
<br/>
<b>Also seriously inside the bubble of an introvert's personal space. We've known Yuri for less than twenty-four hours now.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: I see...well, just tell me if I end up distracting you or anything."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: A-Alright..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>I open the book and start the prologue. I soon understand what Yuri means about reading in company. It's as if I can feel her presence over my shoulder as I read. It's not a particularly bad thing. Maybe a little distracting, but the feeling is somewhat comforting. Yuri is in the corner of my eye. I realize that she's not actually looking at her own book. I glance over. It looks like she's reading from my book instead...</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>Reading over a shoulder is an interesting trait to have, I suppose. Mitayo doesn't seem to mind too much, at least.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: S-Sorry! I was just--!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Yuri, you really apologize a lot, don't you?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: I...I do? I don't really mean to..."<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<b>Jokes.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Ahaha. Here, this should work, right?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>I slide my desk until it's up against Yuri's, then hold my book more between the two of them.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-20171011190046_1.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Ah...I suppose so..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri timidly closes her own copy. Once we each lean in a little bit, our shoulders are almost touching. It feels like my left arm is in the way, so instead I use my right hand to hold the book open.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>I used to share textbooks with people back in school. It was super awkward and I hated every minute of it, so I'm glad Mitayo and Yuri seem to be enjoying it well enough.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Ah, I guess that makes it kind of difficult to turn the page..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Here..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri takes her left arm and holds the left side of the book between her thumb and forefinger.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Ah..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>I do the same with my right arm, on the right side of the book. That way, I turn a page, and Yuri slides it under her thumb after it flips to her side. But in holding it like this...we're huddled even closer together than before.<br/>
<br/>
It's actually kind of distracting me...! It's as if I can feel the warmth of Yuri's face, and she's in the corner of my vision...</i><br/>

<br/>
<i>We continue reading. Yuri no longer asks me if I'm ready to turn the page; instead, I just assume that she finishes the page before me, so I turn it by my own volition. We continue the first chapter in silence. Even so, turning each page almost feels like an intimate exchange... my thumb gently letting go of the page, letting it flutter over to her side as she catches it under her own thumb.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Well, I guess she's more blunt in a lot of ways...but she also second-guesses all of the things that she says and does. Like she's afraid she'll do something wrong. It's not like I can see into your head or anything...but they're kind of reminiscent of some of your mannerisms."<br/>

<i>Sayori and Monika enthusiastically pull out their poems. Sayori's is on a wrinkled sheet of loose leaf torn from a spiral notebook. On the other hand, Monika wrote hers in a composition notebook. I can already see Monika's pristine handwriting from where I sit. Natsuki and Yuri reluctantly comply as well, reaching into their bags. I do the same, myself.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>I love how the majority of the group hates this assignment. Only Monika and Sayori - the club president and the VP - are into sharing poetry in any way.</b><br/>

<b>Alright, guys, <u>VOTE TIME</u> - in what order should we share our poem with the girls? This is definitely an important decision that has REAL consequences and not a natural stopping point mixed with obvious and shameless response padding!<br/>
