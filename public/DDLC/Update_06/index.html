<i>I've gotten a little more comfortable here over the past couple days. Entering the clubroom, the usual scene greets me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Hi Mitayo~"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Yo, Sayori. Looks like you're in a good mood today."<br/>
<br/>
<b>Sayori's always in a good mood. This shouldn't be a huge surprise.</b><br/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Ehehe~ I'm just still not used to you being in the club, that's all."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: I see...that's a pretty simple thing to get you in a good mood. But I guess it's always the simple things with you, anyway."<br/>
<br/>
<b>Rude?</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-20171015191013_1.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: I'm kinda hungry...will you come with me to buy a snack?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: No thanks."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Eh?? T-That's not like you at all!!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: I have my reasons. Why don't we take a look at your purse, Sayori?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: E-Eh? Why that...all of a sudden?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: No reason, really. I just wanted to look at it."<br/>
<br/>
<b>I'm thinking of getting one myself. Is that Gucci or what?</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: A-Ah..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Sayori nervously retrieves her coin purse. She fumbles with the latch and gets it open. Then, she turns it upside-down and lets its contents spill onto the desk. Only two small coins fall out.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/5-20171015191026_1.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: I knew it...I can see right through you, Sayori."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: That's not fair! How did you even know?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: It's simple. If you had enough money in the first place, you would have bought a snack before coming to the clubroom. So, either you're not hungry and wanted an excuse to take a walk...or, you planned to conveniently forget that you spent all your money, so that I would lend you some!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: But there's one more thing...you're always hungry! And so, that only leaves the one option!"<br/>
<br/>
<b>Easy there, Pheonix, she just wanted a snack. No need for the third degree.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Uwaaa~! I give up! Don't make me feel guiltyyy!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: If you feel guilty, that means you deserve to feel guilty..."<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>Yuri suddenly giggles.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Eh?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>I didn't notice that she was listening in. Her face is in her book, as always.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/7-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: A-Ah! I wasn't listening or anything--! It was just...something in my book..."<br/>
<br/>
<b>Yuri is the worst liar in a group of super-bad liars.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Yuriiii...tell Mitayo to let me borrow some money..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/7-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: That's--! Don't get me involved like that, Sayori. Besides...you should only buy what you can responsibly afford - and frankly, after pulling a mischievous little stunt like that, your suffering is fair enough retribution."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: ..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/7-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Ah--! Did I just...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/8-20171015191042_1.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/7-newyuri7575.jpg"/>:  I got too absorbed into my book...Uu..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Ahaha! I really like when you speak your mind, Yuri...it doesn't happen much, but it's a fun side of you!"<br/>
<br/>
<b>To be fair, she's just parroting what we said a few minutes ago.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/7-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: That's...there's no way you could think that..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: You were right, though...I did something bad and now I have to accept the revolution."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/7-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: <i>Retribution</i>."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: That!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/7-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Still, coming from you, Sayori...I guess there's a little devil inside all of us, isn't there?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Ehehe..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Don't let her fool you. Sayori knows exactly what she's doing. After all, she told you guys she was bringing me to the club before she even told me..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: B-But...! You wouldn't have come if it weren't for the cupcakes...so I had to trick Natsuki into making them!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Come on, give me more credit than that, Sayori."<br/>
<br/>
<b>No, that's actually what happened. I've been mostly kidding about us just showing up for cupcakes, but that's pretty much the only reason you chose to show up back in the first update.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Ehehe..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/9-20171015191057_1.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Kyaa--!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Out of nowhere, something smacks Sayori in the face and tumbles onto the desk.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Ow...what was-- Eh?? A-A cookie!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Sure enough, it's a giant cookie wrapped in plastic. Sayori glances around.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: I-Is this a miracle?? It's because I paid my restitution!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: <i>Retribution.</i>"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/7-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Actually, that one almost worked..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Ahahaha!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: I <i>was</i> just gonna give it to you, but then I heard you blab about the cupcakes. It was totally worth seeing your reaction, though. Ahaha!"<br/>
<br/>
<b>It's interesting that this seems to be a purchased cookie as opposed to one that Natsuki baked herself. It's also interesting for other reasons that I can't get into right now.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: N-Natsuki! That's so nice of you! I'm so happy..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Sayori hugs the cookie.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Jeez, just eat it..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Sayori rapidly tears open the wrapper and takes a big bite.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Sho good...Mmf--!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Sayori suddenly clasps her hands over her mouth.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: I bit my tongue..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/11-20171015191112_1.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: You're going through a lot over just one cookie."<br/>
<br/>
<b>This reinforces my 'Sayori is a puppy' theory.</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Natsuki takes a bite of her own cookie.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Ah, yours looks really good too, Natsuki! Can I try it?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Jeez...beggars can't be choosers!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: But yours is chocolate..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Yeah, why do you think I gave you that one?"<br/>
<br/>
<b>This seems fair. That being said, I would go for a white chocolate macademia nut cookie over most anything other type.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Fine...still, I'm really happy that you shared this one with me. Ehehe~"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Sayori gets out of her seat and goes behind Natsuki, then wraps her arms around her. Cookie still in hand, Natsuki reaches up to nudge Sayori off of her.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-20171015191120_1.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Sayori suddenly leans down and takes a bite out of Natsuki's cookie.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: H-Hey!! Did you seriously just do that?!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Uhuhuhu!"<br/>
<br/>
<b>I don't have internet on the computer Im writing this on - if I did, I'd put a picture of Jabba here.</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mouth full, Sayori trots away to safety. Yuri and I laugh as well.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Jeez! You're such a kid sometimes! Monika! Can you tell Sayori--eh?"<br/>
<br/>
<b>Natsuki calling someone else a kid is the biggest case of hypocrisy I've seen in a long time.</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Natsuki glances around. Monika isn't in the clubroom.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Ugh...where's Monika, anyway?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/7-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Good question...have any of you heard anything about her being late today?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Not me..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Yeah, I haven't either."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/7-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Hm...that's a bit unusual."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: I hope she's okay..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Of course she's okay. She probably just had something to do today. She's pretty popular, after all..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Eh? You don't think she...she has a...!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/7-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Ahaha. I wouldn't be surprised. She's probably more desirable than all of us combined."<br/>
<br/>
<b>That seems over-the-top, but she is supposed to be the prom queen of the group.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Ehehe, that's true..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Excuse me?!"<br/>
<br/>
<b>Natsuki finally realizes that that's almost a dig.</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Suddenly, the door swings open.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/13-20171015191130_1.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Ah, there you are..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/14-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: I didn't mean to be late...I hope you guys weren't worried or anything!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Eh?? Monika chose the club over her boyfriend after all! You're so strong-willed!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/14-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: B-Boyfriend...? What on Earth are you talking about?"<br/>
<br/>
<b>She runs a literature/poetry club. It might not be as easy as one thinks to get one of those.</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Monika quizzically glances at me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Ah, never mind that...what held you up, anyway?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/14-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Ah...well, my last period today was study hall. To be honest, I kind of just lost track of time...ahaha..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: That makes no sense, though. You would have heard the bell ring, at least."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/14-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: I must not have heard it, since I was practicing piano..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/7-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Piano...? I wasn't aware you played music as well, Monika."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/14-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Ah, I don't, really...! I kind of just started recently. I've always wanted to learn piano."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: That's so cool! You should play something for us, Monika!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/14-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: That's..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Monika looks at me.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Yay~!"<br/>
<br/>
<b>Pretty soon we're going to be the Poetry-And-Piano Club, just you wait. We could call ourselves Doki Doki P-P.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: That sounds cool. I'd also look forward to it."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/14-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Is that so? In that case...I won't let you down, Mitayo."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Monika smiles sweetly.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Ah...I didn't mean any pressure or anything like that!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/14-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Ahaha, don't worry. I've been practicing a whole lot recently. And I'd really love the chance to share once I'm ready."<br/>
<br/>
<b>This is gonna be like the ending of Groundhog Day with Phil Connors, isn't it?</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: I see...in that case, best of luck."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/14-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Thanks~! So, I didn't miss anything, did I?"<br/>
<br/>
<b>Sayori tried to scam me and then she and Natsuki had antics.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Not...not really."<br/>
<br/>
<i>I choose to leave out Sayori's mischievous escapade. I'm sure Natsuki will end up complaining to her, anyway. It looks like everyone has already settled down. Sayori somehow already finished her entire cookie. Yuri is back to her book, and Natsuki disappeared into the closet.</i><br/>

<br/>
<b>This is another boob joke. A lot of girls with big ol' honkers have back problems. This is a known and relatively common problem so I don't know why Yuri's so embarrassed about it, but that's Yuri for you.

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Fair enough. I'll go ahead and get the book."<br/>

<br/>
<b>"Hey Yuri, do you want a kiss? (uncontrollable eigth-grade giggling)"</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri and I then sit against the wall, teacups at our sides. As if in sync, we assume the same reading position as last time, each holding one half of the book. Except this time...our bodies are even closer to each other.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>Okay, yep, I guess they ARE sharing the book again. Seriously, just return the other one, Yuri.</b><br/>

<i>Yuri slides closer until our shoulders are touching. How am I supposed to focus on reading like this...?! Yuri was always kind of cute, but...when she's being less apprehensive, it's almost more than I can handle!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/7-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Your teacup..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri hands me my teacup. Holding it with my hand that's not holding the book, I end up in a position that makes it even harder to focus. Because now I need to worry about making sure I don't accidentally touch her chest...! Meanwhile, Yuri hasn't noticed a single thing. She wears her intense reading expression, and I can only presume the world around her has faded away. I use all of my willpower to focus on reading.<br/>
<br/>
After a few minutes, I finally manage to relax a little. I put the teacup between my legs and fumble with the chocolate wrapper.</i><br/>

<br/>
<i>Yuri is already totally focused on reading again. I take a chocolate candy and pop it into my mouth. Then, I take another chocolate...and I hold it up to Yuri. She doesn't even look away from the book. She simply parts her lips, as if this situation was completely natural. But that means I can't stop here! I apprehensively place the chocolate in her mouth.
