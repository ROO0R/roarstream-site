<b>Well, aren't you chipper this morning?</b><br/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: I've been waiting for you. Are you ready to continue reading? I brought my best tea today--"<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: I told you not to-- Ugh...is she really late again?"<br/>
<br/>
<b>I can only assume that Natsuki is upset about Monika moving around her manga again, though it's not expressly stated.</b><br/>

<b>Oh. Well, maybe she's not quite as pleasant this morning as I thought.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: What are you talking about?! You say that like I do it on a regular basis or something. I just wasn't paying attention, okay? I'm sorry."<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Look...I did some thinking about yesterday. I was a little more hostile than I meant to be...I guess I really felt threatened or something. But I know this is something we're doing together. Another new member wouldn't hurt, as long as they're cool...and I guess another girl would be nice this time..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: So..."<br/>

<br/>
<b>That...seemed really uncalled for. Apparently whatever conclusion Yuri came to last night about the club and unity and whatnot is long gone now. As an aside, that would have gone differently had we made different decisions, so our input does still matter in the most basic of senses.</b><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: I'm the last one here again!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Were you practicing piano again?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Yeah...Ahaha..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: You must have a lot of determination. Starting this club, and still trying to make time for piano..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Well, maybe not determination...but I guess passion. It motivates me to work hard for the festival, too."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Anyway, Mitayo...what do you want to do today? I was thinking we could--"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/13-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>I...don't remember agreeing to this.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Ah...is that so, Yuri?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: That's correct. Mitayo is already engaged in a novel that we're reading together. Aren't you glad I've already gotten him into literature, Monika?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: I...I suppose..."<br/>

<br/>
<b>This is the first time we get to see <i>this</i>. Get used to it - you'll know what exactly I'm referring to soon enough.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Um... Thank you for understanding, Monika."<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: ...Do you mind if I make some tea first?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/16-boyavatest.png"/>: "Not at all."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Thanks very much. If there's one thing that can make my reading time here any better, it's a nice cup of tea. Not to mention for yourself, as well."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri stands up and makes her way to the closet. I follow and watch as she retrieves a small water pitcher from the shelf - the kind with a filter inside.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Can you hold this for a second?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/16-boyavatest.png"/>: "Sure..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri hands me the water pitcher and also fetches an electric kettle.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>This portion of play time is nearly - if not completely - identical to the second play time with Yuri in the first timeline, but it's not long enough to justify fast-forward mode. It'll switch up very soon.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: I'm going to plug this in at the teacher's desk, and then I'll go get some water."<br/>
<br/>
<i>She walks past me and sets the kettle down on the teacher's desk. I simply watch her movements. To my surprise, the way she moves really contrasts her speaking mannerisms. Especially because of her long legs, Yuri appears elegant and methodical.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Okay, may I have the water pitcher?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Thanks. I'll be right back."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/16-boyavatest.png"/>: "Ah, I might as well walk with you..."<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: You stay here...it won't take long."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Pitcher in hand, Yuri hurries out of the classroom.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: ...did Yuri leave you again?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/16-boyavatest.png"/>: "No, it's not like that this time. She's just filling up the water pitcher to make tea."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Oh, okay! Sorry for misunderstanding~"<br/>

<br/>
<i>Ten minutes pass. Yuri said it wouldn't take long...is something holding her up? I'm bored just waiting here, so I decide to go look for her.</i><br/>

BGM: Play With Me becomes muffled while in the hallway, as if someone is blasting it from inside the classroom and we can hear it through the walls. It's a nice touch.<br/>
<br/>
<i>The most logical place for Yuri to be would be the nearest water fountain...I start heading down the hallway.</i><br/>

<br/>
<i>A sharp inhale, like someone is sucking the air through their teeth. Are they in pain...?</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>I have a bad feeling about this.</b><br/>

I was doing a bit of thinking...and I decided that I would try expressing myself a little bit more. It turns out it's not very hard for me to do...when it's you who's around, anyway."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/25-boy_75_75_border.jpg"/>: Ah...that's great, Yuri! Just don't push yourself too much."<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/25-boy_75_75_border.jpg"/>: Eh? Why's that?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/26-Yuri_75_75_w_border.jpg"/>: It's a little bit easier on my back...I can read with my back against the wall rather than bending over at my desk."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/25-boy_75_75_border.jpg"/>: Ah, sorry, I didn't realize."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/26-Yuri_75_75_w_border.jpg"/>: No worries. I just have back pain fairly regularly, so I do my best to manage it."<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/26-Yuri_75_75_w_border.jpg"/>: It's most likely because my--ah--m-my..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/25-boy_75_75_border.jpg"/>: Your posture, right? Always hunched over like that while reading..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/26-Yuri_75_75_w_border.jpg"/>: Yes! I have terrible reading posture! So that's why we should sit on the floor."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/25-boy_75_75_border.jpg"/>: Fair enough. I'll go ahead and get the book."<br/>
<br/>
<i>I retrieve the book from my bag.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/25-boy_75_75_border.jpg"/>: Ah, I have some chocolate as well..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's a bag of small chocolate candies. I take it, since it'll go well with the tea.</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri and I then sit against the wall, teacups at our sides. As if in sync, we assume the same reading position as last time, each holding one half of the book. Except this time...our bodies are even closer to each other.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/26-Yuri_75_75_w_border.jpg"/>: I can't see too well..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/25-boy_75_75_border.jpg"/>: --!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri slides closer until our shoulders are touching. How am I supposed to focus on reading like this...?! Yuri was always kind of cute, but...when she's being less apprehensive, it's almost more than I can handle!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/26-Yuri_75_75_w_border.jpg"/>: Your teacup..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri hands me my teacup. Holding it with my hand that's not holding the book, I end up in a position that makes it even harder to focus. Because now I need to worry about making sure I don't accidentally touch her chest...! Meanwhile, Yuri hasn't noticed a single thing. She wears her intense reading expression, and I can only presume the world around her has faded away. I use all of my willpower to focus on reading.<br/>
<br/>
After a few minutes, I finally manage to relax a little. I put the teacup between my legs and fumble with the chocolate wrapper.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/25-boy_75_75_border.jpg"/>: Ah, sorry..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>I briefly let go of the book to finish opening the wrapper.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/25-boy_75_75_border.jpg"/>: You can have as much as you want."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/26-Yuri_75_75_w_border.jpg"/>: Ah, that's...that's okay, I won't take any..."<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/26-Yuri_75_75_w_border.jpg"/>: Well...if I touch it, then it might get smudges on the pages..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/25-boy_75_75_border.jpg"/>: Ah, you're right...I didn't even think about that. My bad..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/26-Yuri_75_75_w_border.jpg"/>: No need to apologize. I'll hold the book, okay?"<br/>

<br/>
<i>Yuri is already totally focused on reading again. I take a chocolate candy and pop it into my mouth. Then, I take another chocolate...and I hold it up to Yuri. She doesn't even look away from the book. She simply parts her lips, as if this situation was completely natural. But that means I can't stop here! I apprehensively place the chocolate in her mouth. Just like that, Yuri closes her lips over it.</i><br/>
