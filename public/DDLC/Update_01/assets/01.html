<b>Welcome to Doki Doki Literature Club!</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/5-20171009223432_1.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Our name is Mitayo. There is literally zero rhyme or reason behind this whatsoever beyond I wanted something vaguely Japanese-sounding and also I didnt want him to be named Dongs.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/6-20171009223439_1.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
BGM: <a href="http://www.polsy.org.uk/play/yt/?vurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DW-vcSYp1CTg&amp;autoplay=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ohayou Sayori!</a> **New!**<br/>
<br/>
<i>I see an annoying girl running toward me from the distance, waving her arms in the air like she's totally oblivious to any attention she might draw to herself. That girl is Sayori, my neighbor and good friend since we were children. You know, the kind of friend you'd never see yourself making today, but it just kind of works out because you've known each other for so long? </i><br/>
<br/>
<i>We used to walk to school together on days like this, but starting around high school she would oversleep more and more frequently, and I would get tired of waiting up. But if she's going to chase after me like this, I almost feel better off running away. However, I just sigh and idle in front of the crosswalk and let Sayori catch up to me. </i><br/>
<br/>
<b>I'm not entirely sure why Mitayo starts off the game by being so annoyed over Sayori. I think hes going for a roasting-my-friend sort of vibe but it doesnt come across very well. It's not a great first impression, but it never really comes up again. He actually does consider her a friend. </b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/7-20171009223446_1.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/8-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: I overslept again! But I caught you this time!"<br/>
<br/>
<b>So this is Sayori - like the MC mentioned a minute ago, she's a bit of a flake. She's super nice, though, and a generally worthwhile person to know. She's the typical 'has always been my best friend' character - kind of the middle of the road with no obvious glaring faults.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/9-boyavatest.png"/>: Maybe, but only because I decided to stop and wait for you."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/8-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Eeehhhhh, you say that like you were thinking about ignoring me! That's mean, Mitayo!"<br/>
<br/>
<b>He was and it is.<br/>
<br/>
As an aside, the male POV never appears in the game. The portrait I went with was on the first page GIS search of Japanese high school boy and I have no idea where hes from.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/9-boyavatest.png"/>: Well, if people stare at you for acting weird then I don't want them to think we're a couple or something."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/8-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Fine, fine. But you did wait for me, after all. I guess you don't have it in you to be mean even if you want to~"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/9-boyavatest.png"/>: Whatever you say, Sayori..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/8-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Ehehe~"<br/>
<br/>
<b>This game is not voiced. No weird awkward laughter to cap here.</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>We cross the street together and make our way to school. As we draw near, the streets become increasingly speckled with other students making their daily commute. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/10-20171009223502_1.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/8-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Have you decided on a club to join yet?"<br/>
<br/>
<b>High schools in anime and VNs are super-into extracurricular clubs. How much of this leaks from real life is beyond me because I'm an uncultured idiot. It certainly happens in media enough.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/9-boyavatest.png"/>: A club? I told you already, I'm really not interested in joining any clubs. I haven't been looking, either."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/8-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: "Eh? That's not true! You told me you would join a club this year!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/9-boyavatest.png"/>: Did I...?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm sure it's possible that I did, in one of our many conversations where I dismissively go along with whatever she's going on about. Sayori likes to worry a little too much about me, when I'm perfectly content just getting by on the average while spending my free time on games and anime. </i><br/>
<br/>
<b>...they really are friends. He really does like her, I promise. <img alt="" border="0" src="Update_01/assets/images/frown.gif" title=":("/></b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/8-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: "Uh-huh! I was talking about how I'm worried that you won't learn how to socialize or have any skills before college. Your happiness is really important to me, you know!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/8-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: And I know you're happy now, but I'd die at the thought of you becoming a NEET in a few years because you're not used to the real world! You trust me, right?"<br/>
<br/>
<b>NEET is apparently an acronym for 'Not in Education, Employment, or Training.I'd never heard this term before so if you're in the same boat I was, you're welcome.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/9-boyavatest.png"/>: Alright, alright...I'll look at a few clubs if it makes you happy."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/8-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Will you at least promise me you'll try a little?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/11-20171009223518_1.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/9-boyavatest.png"/>: Yeah, I guess I'll promise you that."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/8-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Yaay~!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Why do I let myself get lectured by such a carefree girl? More than that, I'm surprised I even let myself relent to her. I guess seeing her worry so much about me makes me want to ease her mind at least a little bit - even if she does exaggerate everything inside her head. </i><br/>
<br/>
<b>There! That's a little bit of caring! I told you!</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/12-20171009223529_1.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>The screen transitions into this classroom. I think we only come here once or twice, so enjoy it while it lasts.</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>The school day is as ordinary as ever, and it's over before I know it. After I pack up my things, I stare blankly at the wall, looking for an ounce of motivation. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/9-boyavatest.png"/>: Clubs..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Sayori wants me to check out some clubs. I guess I have no choice but to start with the anime club... </i><br/>
<br/>
<b>Literally no choice whatsoever. I'll get rid of my NEET status in no time if I spend my after-school hours talking about Tuxedo Mask and Goku!</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/8-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Hellooo?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/13-20171009223543_1.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Get used to Sayori. While the other girls do make a grand appearance very, very soon, it's pretty obvious that Sayori is the obvious forerunner for love interest.</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Sayori must have come into the classroom while I was spacing out. I look around and realize that I'm the only one left in the classroom. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/8-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: I thought I'd catch you coming out of the classroom, but I saw you just sitting here and spacing out, so I came in. Honestly, you're even worse than me sometimes...I'm impressed!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/9-boyavatest.png"/>: You don't need to wait up for me if it's going to make you late to your own club."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/8-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Well, I thought you might need some encouragement, so I thought, you know..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/9-boyavatest.png"/>: Know what?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/14-20171009223604_1.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>You have about four and a half lines of dialogue to guess which club Sayori's a part of.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/9-boyavatest.png"/>: Sayori..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/8-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Yeah??"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/9-boyavatest.png"/>: ...There is no way I'm going to your club."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/8-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Eeeehhhhh?! Meanie!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Sayori is vice president of the Literature Club - not that I was ever aware that she had any interest in literature. In fact, I'm 99% sure she only did it because she thought it would be fun to help start a new club.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>Knowing Sayori's character, this is probably entirely true.</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Since she was the first one to show interest after the one who proposed the club, she inherited the title "Vice President". That said, my interest in literature is guaranteed to be even less.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/9-boyavatest.png"/>: Yeah. I'm going to the anime club."<br/>
<br/>
<b>Tempt me not, woman! Anime awaits!</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/8-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: C'mon, please?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/9-boyavatest.png"/>: Why do you care so much, anyway?"<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/8-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: I kind of told the club yesterday I would bring in a new member...and Natsuki made cupcakes and everything...ehehe..."<br/>
<br/>
<b>Free food, you say...?</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/9-boyavatest.png"/>: Don't make promises you can't keep!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>I can't tell if Sayori is really that much of an airhead, or if she's so cunning as to have planned all of this out. I let out a long sigh. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/9-boyavatest.png"/>: Fine...I'll stop by for a cupcake, okay?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="Update_01/assets/images/8-newsayori7575.jpg"/>: Yes! Let's go~!"<br/>
<br/>
<b>It's hard not to like Sayori. She's so bubbly all the time, even over little stuff.</b><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<b>I want this on my tombstone.</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>I dejectedly follow Sayori across the school and upstairs - a section of the school I rarely visit, being generally used for third-year classes and activities. </i><br/>
<br/>
<b>I don't think it's even mentioned exactly what year of school he's in.</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Sayori, full of energy, swings open the classroom door. </i><br/>
