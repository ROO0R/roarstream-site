<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Well, 'excited' may not be the right word...but I suppose I'm looking forward to it a little bit."<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: And also...your cupcakes are the best cupcakes I've ever had! They go really well with my tea! And nothing that I do for the event will compare to that, so...so..."<br/>
<br/>
<b>Gonna be honest, I kind of want a cupcake now.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: I get it, I get it. I'm kinda surprised, though..."<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Um...well, I'm the one acting immature...I already know that."<br/>
<br/>
<b>This is an interesting sidebar. Natsuki is actually self-aware of what a brat she's being. This can be considered progress!</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/14-image011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: I-I know I'm not very good at it...I'm sorry if I said something bad!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Natsuki isn't the only one surprised. Monika and I are also taken aback by Yuri's words. When she already has trouble with words, trying to cheer someone up must be far out of her own comfort zone. But I begin to understand. <br/>
<br/>
Yuri was trying to sound like Sayori.<br/>
<br/>
Even if it didn't work perfectly, I can tell that she tried to say something Sayori would say at a time like this. Because Sayori always helps everyone smile and feel good about themselves.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>Sayori does certainly bring a balance to the group. When she's not here, the loss is noticed.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: No...I kinda appreciated it. I'm sorry...for making a big deal out of nothing. But I'm going to say this."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: ...?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: You better bet that my cupcakes are going to be the best part of the whole event!"<br/>
<br/>
<b>Compared to reciting poetry from a stage, I wholeheartedly agree with her.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Ah...I believe you."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/6-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Yeah!"<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/6-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: But with that...there's nothing more for today. So I guess it's time for us to head out."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Alright, let's get out of here, then."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Everyone packs up their things. I start to follow Monika and Natsuki out the door as they chat between each other.</i><br/>

<br/>
<i>I decide not to press Yuri for a reason. It's not like it should matter much either way, so I'll just need to make sure my room is clean.</i><br/>

<b>You overwhelming won the vote, Yuri. Don't sell yourself short here.</b><br/>

<b>I can think of two very big reasons.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: "You're forgetting the one reason with the most common sense! I chose to help you because that's what I want to do."<br/>

<b>"And also because the game didn't let me pick Sayori or Monika. But mostly because I wanted to!"</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: B-But..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri thinks to herself with an extremely tense expression.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: "Yuri...you're overthinking this. You wanted me to point out when you're overthinking, right?"<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: ...I believe you!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>As if it took her tremendous effort, Yuri finally says that and relaxes her expression.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: And I'm really looking forward to Sunday."<br/>
<br/>
<b>Wait a second, I just thought of something. Can't I just work with Natsuki on Saturday...? Why did I have to choose in the first place?</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: "Yeah...I am too."<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/19-image016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri is going to be coming to my house on Sunday...? Even though I would have preferred to do this with Sayori...my anxiety still shoots through the roof. I guess I've gotten pretty used to handling her at this point...but who knows what might end up happening when we're outside of school? She even told me she was looking forward to it...<br/>
<br/>
I shake my head. Why do I feel nervous that Sayori finds out about this? It's not like we feel </i>that<i> way about each other...besides, like Monika said, this is about the club. I have nothing to worry about.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/20-image017.jpg"/><br/>

<b>Besides, we're making decorations, not frenching.<br/>

<br/>
<i>I've been getting increasingly anxious about Yuri's upcoming visit. I keep telling myself there's no reason to be nervous, but it doesn't help much. Yuri is clearly an introvert and also an intimate person in general. There's no doubt that she'll open up a little bit when it's just the two of us. Meanwhile, we've even been texting occasionally. She was extremely apprehensive at first, but it wasn't long before I was already learning more about her.<br/>
<br/>
But putting Yuri aside...I haven't heard a thing from Sayori since she left club early the other day. It's not like we text each other all the time or anything...but I've been worried about her in the back of my mind. Between what Sayori said, and what Monika said...Is it really okay for me to put Sayori's feelings aside when she might need me?</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>Regardless of the fact that we haven't been macking on Sayori, she <i>is</i> still our best friend.</b><br/>

<i>Rather than asking, I simply tell her "I'm coming over", much like we've done in the past. Once I reach Sayori's house, I knock on the door before entering it myself. Again, we used to play so often that we've made it a habit of simply entering each other's houses like we were family.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>And no one locks their door, apparently.</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>The house is quiet. Sayori isn't anywhere on the first floor, so I assume she's up in her room. It's already strange of her not to run down and greet me. I head up to her bedroom, where I finally find her.</i><br/>

<br/>
<i>I sit down in her room. Sayori forces a smile, but it's easy to tell that she's different. There's a minute of silence between us.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/24-image020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>This is our first view of Sayori out of her school uniform. It's hard to tell behind the text box, but she's wearing short shorts. I forgot to get a better screenshot here, but don't worry - we'll get a much better view in a couple of updates.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: "Ah... I guess you're right. It has been a long time. Not much has really changed, has it?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Sayori's room is as messy as it's always been. I also recognize the same stuffed animals and wall decorations that she's had for years now.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>I like the duck-thing in the back there.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/23-NewSaycasual.png"/>: Ehehe~ If you came over more often, it wouldn't be such a mess."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: "That's because I end up cleaning it for you..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/23-NewSaycasual.png"/>: How come you suddenly wanted to come over today? Aren't you supposed to see Yuri today?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: "Yeah, but...wait, how did you know that?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Sayori had already left by the time we decided that last meeting."</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/23-NewSaycasual.png"/>: Monika told me. It's only natural for her to keep me informed about the festival preparations, right?"<br/>
<br/>
<b>Gossip again. You ladies. <img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/rolleyes.gif" title=":rolleyes:"/></b><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/23-NewSaycasual.png"/>: Of course! But I'm just helping her online. We didn't plan to meet up or anything."<br/>
<br/>
<b>So are you guys going on Discord and screensharing or something? How are you helping her design from here?</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: "Ah, so it's just me and Yuri, then..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/23-NewSaycasual.png"/>: Yep~"<br/>
<br/>
<i>There's more silence between us. Sayori stares in a random direction. Everything about her behavior is really uncharacteristic. I finally get to the point.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: "I just...wanted to see how you were doing. After you left on Friday. When something's wrong, you can't hide it from me! I know you too well. So..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Sayori smiles, shaking her head.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/23-NewSaycasual.png"/>: That's no good, Mitayo."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: "Eh?"<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/23-NewSaycasual.png"/>: This is all my fault. If I didn't get so weak and accidentally express my feelings...if I didn't make that stupid mistake...then you wouldn't have been worried about me at all. You wouldn't have come here. You wouldn't have even been thinking about me right now."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/23-NewSaycasual.png"/>: But this...is just my punishment, isn't it? I'm getting punished for being so selfish. I think that's why the world decided to have you come over today. It just wants to torture me. Ehehe~"<br/>
<br/>
<b>We're here because we're worried about you, Sayori. It's that simple.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: "Sayori!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>I grab Sayori by the shoulders.</i><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: "What on Earth are you saying?! Are you listening to yourself right now? I know something happened to you.

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/23-NewSaycasual.png"/>: Ah...ahaha..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Sayori gives me an empty smile.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/23-NewSaycasual.png"/>: You really put me in a trap, Mitayo. But...you're wrong. Nothing happened to me. I've always been like this. You're just seeing it for the first time."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: "Seeing what? What are you talking about, Sayori?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/23-NewSaycasual.png"/>: Ehehe~ You're really just going to make me say it, aren't you, Mitayo? I guess I have no choice this time. The thing is..."<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/23-NewSaycasual.png"/>: Did you know that? Why do you think I'm late to school every day? Because most days, I can't even find a reason to get out of bed. What reason is there to do anything when I fully know how worthless I am?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/23-NewSaycasual.png"/>: Why go to school?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/23-NewSaycasual.png"/>: Why eat?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/23-NewSaycasual.png"/>: Why make friends?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/23-NewSaycasual.png"/>: Why make other people put their energy and caring to waste by having them spend it on me?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/23-NewSaycasual.png"/>: That's what it feels like. And that's why I just want to make everyone happy...without anyone worrying about me."<br/>
<br/>
<b>I don't have depression - or, at least, I don't think I do. From people very close to me, however, this seems to be a relatively accurate depiction of it.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: "..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm in shock. I can't even figure out how to respond. How is it possible that Sayori kept this from me the entire time that I've known her? Did she really want so badly for me to just not think about her?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: "...Why, Sayori?"<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: "Why is it that you've never told me about this? It almost feels like I've been betrayed as your close friend. Because if I knew, I would have done everything I could to support you! Even if there's only so much that I could do...I would have tried a little bit harder to make every day a little better for you."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: "That's why I'm your friend! All you had to do was tell me!"<br/>
<br/>
<b>This does not seem like the most...helpful response. This isn't about <i>you</i>, Mitayo.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/23-NewSaycasual.png"/>: You don't understand at all, Mitayo. Why do you think I didn't tell you? Because if I told you, then you would have to waste effort caring about me instead of doing important things. I don't want to be cared about. It's bittersweet, when people try to care about me. It feels nice sometimes. But it also feels like a bat being swung against my head."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/23-NewSaycasual.png"/>: Ahaha~ that's why I wanted so badly for you to make friends with everyone else..."<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/23-NewSaycasual.png"/>: But then, I discovered something else, too. Seeing you make friends and get closer with everyone in the club...it feels like a spear going through my heart. So, that's why. That's why I decided the world just wants to torture me. Every path leads to nothing but hurt. Ahaha~"<br/>
<br/>
<b>The whole situation is really a huge catch-22 for Sayori.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: "You're right that I don't understand...I don't understand your feelings at all, Sayori. But I don't need to understand. Whatever it takes for me to help you stop hurting...that's what I'll do."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/23-NewSaycasual.png"/>: No, Mitayo. There's nothing. Nothing at all. The only thing that could have helped is if everything could be like it always was. But I was selfish. I finally showed you what a horrible person I am."<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/23-NewSaycasual.png"/>: I made you join the literature club because I was selfish. And I was punished by my heart hurting in a way that I couldn't understand. And now you came here and I made you hurt, too. I'm just weak and selfish. That's all I am."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/23-NewSaycasual.png"/>: And that's why I'm going to accept these punishments. Because I deserve every last one...!"<br/>
<br/>
<b>The game never mentions whether or not Sayori is seeing anyone for her depression. If she isn't, she really should - this is something she needs to get out with a professional, not someone as emotionally inexperienced as Mitayo.</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Without thinking, I once again grab Sayori's shoulders. This time, I pull her into a tight embrace.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>The background dissolves to black.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/23-NewSaycasual.png"/>: A-Ah--Mitayo..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: "Sayori, I don't care if you feel selfish. I'm really happy that you convinced me to join the club. Seeing you every day makes it worthwhile enough. If I make friends with everyone else, then that's just a bonus. But please never underestimate how much I care about you. I wouldn't have it any other way."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/23-NewSaycasual.png"/>: Mitayo..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Sayori isn't hugging me back. Despite my arms being wrapped around her, Sayori's arms remain at her sides. She starts sobbing next to my ear.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/23-NewSaycasual.png"/>: No...don't do this...to me...please don't do this..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/23-NewSaycasual.png"/>: Mitayo...I..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Sayori barely manages to speak between her sobs. I don't know if I'm doing the right thing. But all I want is for her to know that I care.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: "If you have it in you to call yourself selfish, then you have to let me be selfish too. No matter what it takes, I'll figure out what needs to change. I'll make these feelings go away. And if there's anything that you need me to do...then you'd better tell me. I'll get mad if you don't."<br/>

<i>Gently, Sayori finally puts her arms around me in return.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/23-NewSaycasual.png"/>: I don't know anything. It's all really scary...I don't understand any of my feelings, Mitayo...the only time I'm not feeling nothing is when I'm feeling pain."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/23-NewSaycasual.png"/>: But...your hugs are so warm...and that's really scary, too."<br/>

<i>Sayori lets me go. As she does so, I let her go as well.</i><br/>

<br/>
<b>On the plus side, this seems like a positive step. Spending some time with Sayori - and just her - might be helpful for her. Just to let her know how much we care for her. <img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/emot-shobon.gif" title=":shobon:"/></b><br/>

<br/>
<i>To my surprise, Sayori shakes her head.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/23-NewSaycasual.png"/>: I'm sorry. I don't know if that would be very good for me today. You understand, right?"<br/>
<br/>
<b>I have a feeling that Yuri would be worse at making Sayori feel better than Mitayo is - and that's saying something.</b><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: "Ah...it's...kind of hard for me to fully understand. But I'm trying my hardest."<br/>
