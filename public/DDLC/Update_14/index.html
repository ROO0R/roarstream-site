<br/>
<i>I should start with Monika. Yesterday she seemed eager to read my poem, and I want her to know I'm putting in effort.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>I passed the effort onto the internet, actually. <img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/emot-effort.gif" title=":effort:"/></b><br/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/1-image0001.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Having a good time so far?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: "Ah...yeah."<br/>
<br/>
<b>I mean, we haven't really done much yet. Knowing what we know, I'll consider that a good thing.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Good! Glad to hear it! By the way, since you're new and everything...if you ever have any suggestions for the club, like new activities, or things we can do better...I'm always listening! Don't be afraid to bring things up, okay?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: "Alright...I'll keep that in mind."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Of course I'll be afraid to bring things up. I'm much better off just going with the flow until I'm more settled in.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Anyway...want to share your poem with me?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: "It's kind of embarrassing, but I guess I have to."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Ahahaha! Don't worry, Mitayo! We're all a little embarrassed today, you know?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/4-image0002.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: "Yeah, that's true."<br/>
<br/>
<i>I hand Monika my poem.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: ...Mhm! I like it, Mitayo!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: "Really...?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: It's a lot cuter than I expected. Ahahaha!"<br/>
<br/>
<b>Kawaii desu =^-~=</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: "Oh jeez..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: No, no! It kind of makes me think of something Natsuki would write. And she's a good writer, too. So take that as a compliment!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: "Ahaha...if you say so."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Yep!"<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/5-image0003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: She'll cling to you like a puppy. Ahaha!"<br/>
<br/>
<b>Remember last time when I said that Monika compared Natsuki to Shel Silverstein?<br/>
<br/>
That...doesn't happen in this timeline.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Natsuki's dad doesn't give her lunch money or leave her any food in the house, so she's in a fussy mood pretty often...but sometimes she just loses all of her strength and shuts down. Like earlier."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: This is just a guess, but I think she's so small because her malnutrition is interfering with her adolescent growth...But hey, some guys are into petite girls too, you know? Sorry...just trying to look at the bright side!"<br/>
<br/>
<b>That doesn't explain those evil swirling death eyes, Monika.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Anyway, do you want to read my poem now? Don't worry, I'm not very good..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: "You sound pretty confident for someone who claims to not be very good."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Well...that's 'cause I have to sound confident. That doesn't mean I always feel that way, you know?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: "I see...well, let's read it, then."<br/>
<br/>
<b>This poem, and Monika's response, are identical to the first time we went through this scenario. Feel free to skip the following quote unless you're interested in a refresher.</b><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: Hmm...it's very...freeform, if that's what you call it. Sorry, I'm not really the right person to ask for feedback..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Ahaha. It's okay. Yeah, that kind of style has gotten pretty popular nowadays. That is, a lot of poems have been putting emphasis on the timing between words and lines. When performed out loud, it can be really powerful."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: What was the inspiration behind this one?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Ah...well, I'm not sure if I know how to put it..."<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: It's been influencing my poems a bit."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/3-boyavatest.png"/>: An epiphany?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Yeah...something like that. I'm kind of nervous to talk about deep stuff like that, because it's kind of coming on strongly...maybe after everyone is better friends with each other. Anyway..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Here's Monika's Writing Tip of the Day!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Sometimes when you're writing a poem - or a story - your brain gets too fixated on a specific point...if you try so hard to make it perfect, then you'll never make any progress. Just force yourself to get something down on the paper, and tidy it up later! Another way to think about it is this: If you keep your pen in the same spot for too long, you'll just get a big dark puddle of ink. So just move your hand, and go with the flow!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: ...That's my advice for today!"<br/>

I think the most noticeable thing I recognize in new writers is that they try to make their style very deliberate.

I guess that's what I ended up getting myself into. <br/>
<br/>
Across the room, Monika is writing something in her notebook. My eyes land on Yuri and Natsuki. They gingerly exchange sheets of paper, sharing their respective poems. As they read in tandem, I watch each of their expressions change. Natsuki's eyebrows furrow in frustration. Meanwhile, Yuri smiles sadly.</i><br/>
