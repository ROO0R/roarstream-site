Alright, so heres the thing  if I go on from here, this update would be way shorter than Id likeand honestly, all of the responses have interesting character development. This is the conclusion were going with, but since I had a lot of spare time this morning, Im going to include the other two options as well. Am I not merciful?<br/>
<br/>
I have no intentions of doing this for every decision in this game, so dont get used to it. Unless, of course, I do in fact do it for every decision in this game. Only time will tell!</b><br/>
