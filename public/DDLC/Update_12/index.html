<b>Well. That could have gone better.<br/>
<br/>
Anywaysthe games not over yet by a long shot. We still havent written our way into someones heart  and the game does still offer us that chance. Heres the thing, though. For all of its fantastic writing, there does seem to be certainflawsin the coding. You probably noticed some of it during the discovery of Sayoris body, but the errors, uh<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/1-rr3azGo.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
get worse. The top option  which used to be New Game  is now a jumbled mess. I forgot to get a screenshot, but our save files are still there. Unfortunately, the bizarre way this game handles Sayoris suicide makes them inaccessible:</b><br/>

<br/>
<b>The games not lying  auto-deleting her game data is how the dev decided to handle her death. Its weird at best, sloppy at worst. After the error message, all previous save files that contain Sayori are auto-deleted. Reinstalling the game and getting back to this point yields identical results, so I guess were stuck for it. Looks like were startin over, boys!</b><br/><br/>

<br/>
sort of. The version in-game is a little off-key and slightly distorted. I have no way of accessing it and cant find it on YouTube, but the game files list it as 3g.ogg.<br/>

<br/>
<i>You know, the kind of friend you'd never see yourself making today, but it just kind of works out because you've known each other for so long? We used to walk to school together on days like this, but starting around high school she would oversleep more and more frequently, and I would get tired of waiting up. But if she's going to chase after me like this, I almost feel better off running away.</i><br/>

<b>The game crashes to black, then restarts a second later.<br/>

<i>Mornings are usually the worst, being surrounded by couples and friend groups walking to school together. Meanwhile, I've always walked to school alone. I always tell myself it's about time I meet some girls or something like that...but I have no motivation to join any clubs.<br/>
<br/>
I'm perfectly content just getting by on the average while spending my free time on games and anime. There's always the anime club, but it's not like there would be any girls in it anyway...</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>ah. So that explains it. Apparently getting the Sayori end changes around the opening and there was still some residual code or whatever left over. I hope this gets patched soon - sorry about that!</b><br/>

<br/>
<i>There really aren't any that interest me. Besides, most of them would probably be way too demanding for me to want to deal with. I guess I have no choice but to start with the anime club... </i><br/>

<b>The game is having an, uh, interesting time loading characters.</b><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-boyavatest.png"/>: Ah...yeah, it has."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Monika smiles sweetly. We do know each other - well, we rarely talked, but we were in the same class last year. Monika was probably the most popular girl in class - smart, beautiful, athletic. Basically, completely out of my league. So, having her smile at me so genuinely feels a little...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-boyavatest.png"/>: What did you come in here for, anyway?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Oh, I've just been looking for some supplies to use for my club. Do you know if there's any construction paper in here? Or markers?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-boyavatest.png"/>: I guess you could check the closet....you're in the debate club, right?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Ahaha, about that..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: I actually quit the debate club."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-boyavatest.png"/>: Really? You quit?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Yeah...to be honest, I can't stand all of the politics around the major clubs. It feels like nothing but arguing about the budget and publicity and how to prepare for events...I'd much rather take something I personally enjoy and make something special out of it."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-boyavatest.png"/>: In that case, what club did you decide to join?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Actually, I'm starting a new one!"<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-boyavatest.png"/>: Literature...?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>That sounds kind of...dull?</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>Oh, trust us, Mitayo  it has its interesting points.<br/>
<br/>
In case its not obvious, Mitayo has no memories of what happened in our previous run.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-boyavatest.png"/>: How many members do you have so far?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Um...ahaha...it's kind of embarrassing, but there are only three of us so far. It's really hard to find new members for something that sounds so boring..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-boyavatest.png"/>: Well, I can see that..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: But it's really not boring at all, you know! Literature can be anything. Reading, writing, poetry..."<br/>
<br/>
<b>But mostly poetry!</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: I mean, one of my members even keeps her manga collection in the clubroom..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-boyavatest.png"/>: Wait...really?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Yeah, it's funny, right? She always insists that manga is literature, too. I mean, she's not wrong, I guess...and besides, a member's a member, right?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>...Did Monika say "she"? Hmm...</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>GRILS <img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/emot-derp.gif" title=":derp:"/></b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Hey, Mitayo...by any chance...are you still looking for a club to join?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-boyavatest.png"/>: Ah--I mean, I guess so, but..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: In that case...is there any chance you could do me a big favor? I won't ask you to join, but...if you could at the very least visit my club, it would make me really happy. Please?"<br/>
<br/>
<b>Will there be cupcakes?</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-boyavatest.png"/>: Um..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Well, I guess I have no reason to refuse...besides, how could I ever refuse someone like Monika?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-boyavatest.png"/>: Sure, I guess I could check it out."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Aah, awesome!"<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Shall we go, then? I'll look for the materials another time - you're more important."<br/>
<br/>
<b>I mean, you could do both, but whatever.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/15-image005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>I timidly follow Monika across the school and upstairs - a section of the school I rarely visit, being generally used for third-year classes and activities. Monika, full of energy, swings open the classroom door.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: I'm back~!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: And I brought a guest with me!"<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Don't be mean, Natsuki...But anyway, welcome to the club, Mitayo!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-boyavatest.png"/>: ..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>All words escape me in this situation. This club...is full of incredibly cute girls!!</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>Im getting the strangest sense of déjà vu.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/17-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: So, let me guess...you're Monika's boyfriend, right?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-boyavatest.png"/>: Wha--no, I'm not!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: "Natsuki..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>The girl with the sour attitude, whose name is apparently Natsuki, is one I don't recognize. Her small figure makes me think she's probably a first-year.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: A-Anyway, this is Natsuki, energetic as usual...and this is Yuri, the Vice President!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: I-It's nice to meet you..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri, who appears comparably more mature and timid, seems to have a hard time keeping up with someone like Natsuki.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-boyavatest.png"/>: Yeah... It's nice to meet both of you."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: So, I ran into Mitayo in a classroom, and he decided to come check out the club. Isn't that great?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/19-image006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>I presume the end of this is make cupcakes.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Sorry, sorry! I didn't forget that, but I just happened to run into him."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: "In that case, I should at least make some tea, right?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Yeah, that would be great! Why don't you come sit down, Mitayo?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>The girls have a few desks arranged to form a table. Yuri walks to the corner of the room and opens the closet. Meanwhile, Monika and Natsuki sit across from each other. Still feeling awkward, I take a seat next to Monika.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: So, I know you didn't really plan on coming here..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: But we'll make sure you feel right at home, okay? As president of the Literature Club, it's my duty to make the club fun and exciting for everyone!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-boyavatest.png"/>: I'm surprised there aren't more people in the club yet. It must be hard to start a new club."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: You could put it that way."<br/>
<br/>
<b>We used to have more members, but we just cant seem to hang onto them for very long</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Not many people are very interested in putting out all the effort to start something brand new...especially when it's something that doesn't grab your attention, like literature. You have to work hard to convince people that you're both fun and worthwhile. But it makes school events, like the festival, that much more important. I'm confident that we can all really grow this club before we graduate!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Right, Natsuki?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/17-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Well..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/17-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: ...I guess."<br/>
<br/>
<b>Thats the spirit!</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Natsuki reluctantly agrees. Such different girls, all interested in the same goal...Monika must have worked really hard just to find these two. Yuri returns to the table, carrying a tea set. She carefully places a teacup in front of each of us before setting down the teapot in the middle.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-boyavatest.png"/>: You keep a whole tea set in this classroom?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Don't worry, the teachers gave us permission. After all, doesn't a hot cup of tea help you enjoy a good book?"<br/>
<br/>
<b>Many of the early scenes are nearly identical.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Nearly.</i></b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-boyavatest.png"/>: Ah...I-I guess..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/20-image007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Eh?! T-That's not..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Insulted, Yuri looks away. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: I meant that, you know..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-boyavatest.png"/>: I believe you. Well, tea and reading might not be a pastime for me, but I at least enjoy tea.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: I'm glad..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri faintly smiles to herself in relief.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: So, Mitayo, what kinds of things do you like to read?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-boyavatest.png"/>: Well...ah..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Considering how little I've read these past few years, I don't really have a good way of answering that.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-boyavatest.png"/>: ...Manga..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>I mutter quietly to myself, half-joking. Natsuki's head suddenly perks up - it looks like she wants to say something, but she keeps quiet. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: N-not much of a reader, I guess..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-boyavatest.png"/>: ...Well, that can change..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>What am I saying? I spoke without thinking after seeing Yuri's sad smile. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-boyavatest.png"/>: Anyway, what about you, Yuri?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Well, let's see..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri traces the rim of her teacup with her finger. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: My favorites are usually novels that build deep and complex fantasy worlds. The level of creativity and craftsmanship behind them is amazing to me. And telling a good story in such a foreign world is equally impressive."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuri goes on, clearly passionate about her reading. She seemed so reserved and timid since the moment I walked in, but it's obvious by the way her eyes light up that she finds her comfort in the world of books, not people. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: But you know, I like a lot of things. Stories with deep psychological elements usually immerse me as well. Isn't it amazing how a writer can so deliberately take advantage of your own lack of imagination to completely throw for you a loop? Anyway, I've been reading a lot of horror lately..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-boyavatest.png"/>: Ah, I read a horror book once..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>I desperately grasp something I can relate to at the minimal level. At this rate, Yuri might as well be having a conversation with a rock. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/21-image008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: It suits your personality."<br/>
<br/>
<b>theres something off about this.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Oh, is that so? Really, if a story makes me think, or takes me to another world, then I really can't put it down. Surreal horror is often very successful at changing the way you look at the world, if only for a brief moment."<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Oh? Why's that?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/17-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Well, I just..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Natsuki's eyes dart over to me for a split second. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/17-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Never mind."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: That's right, you usually like to write about cute things, don't you, Natsuki?"<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/17-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: W-What? What gives you that idea?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: You left a piece of scrap paper behind last club meeting. It looked like you were working on a poem called-"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/17-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Don't say it out loud! And give that back!"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Fine, fine~"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-boyavatest.png"/>: Natsuki, you write your own poems?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/17-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Eh? Well, I guess sometimes. Why do you care?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-boyavatest.png"/>: I think that's impressive. Why don't you share them sometime?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/17-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: N-No!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Natsuki averts her eyes.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/17-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: You wouldn't...like them..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-boyavatest.png"/>: Ah...not a very confident writer yet?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: I understand how Natsuki feels. Sharing that level of writing takes more than just confidence. The truest form of writing is writing to oneself. You must be willing to open up to your readers, exposing your vulnerabilities and showing even the deepest reaches of your heart."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Do you have writing experience too, Yuri? Maybe if you share some of your work, you can set an example and help Natsuki feel comfortable enough to share hers."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: !<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-boyavatest.png"/>: I guess it's the same for Yuri..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>We all sit in silence for a moment.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: How about this?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/17-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/> <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: ...?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Natsuki and Yuri look quizzically at Monika. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Let's all go home and write a poem of our own! Then, next time we meet, we'll all share them with each other. That way, everyone is even!"<br/>
<br/>
<b>Thisdidnt go so well last time, but Mitayo doesnt remember that.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/17-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: U-Um..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: ..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Ah...I mean, I thought it was a good idea..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Well...I think you're right, Monika. We should probably start finding activities for all of us to participate in together. I did decide to take on the responsibility of Vice President, after all...I need to do my best to nurture the club as well as its members."<br/>
<br/>
<b>Now that Yuri is vice president, shes apparently taking the role seriously. This is an interesting shift of her character  she was never quite so gung-ho throughout our last run.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: Besides, now that we have a new member...it seems like a good step for us to take. Do you agree as well, Mitayo?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-boyavatest.png"/>: Hold on...there's still one problem."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Eh? What's that?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Now that we've reached the most important topic, I bluntly come forth with what's been on my mind the entire time. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-boyavatest.png"/>: I never said I would join this club! Monika may have convinced me to stop by, but I never made any decision. I still have other clubs to look at, and...um..."<br/>
<br/>
<b>You dont even have cupcakes!</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>I lose my train of thought. All three girls stare back at me with dejected eyes. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: B-But..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: I'm sorry, I thought..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/17-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: Hmph."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-boyavatest.png"/>: Eh...?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>The girls exchange glances before Monika turns back to me. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: I...guess I need to tell you the truth, Mitayo. The thing is..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/24-image011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: We need four...and I've been trying really, really hard to find new members. And if we don't find one more before the festival..."[/i]<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-boyavatest.png"/>: ..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>I...I'm defenseless against these girls. How am I supposed to make a clear-headed decision when it's like this? I would feel terrible for letting everyone down in this situation...and besides, the club itself seems pretty relaxed...so, if writing poems is the price I need to pay in order to spend every day with these beautiful girls... </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-boyavatest.png"/>: ...Right. Okay, I've decided, then. I'll join the Literature Club."<br/>
<br/>
<i>One by one, the girls' eyes light up.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Oh my goodness, really? Do you really mean that, Mitayo?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-boyavatest.png"/>: Yeah...it could be fun, right?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/18-newyuri7575.jpg"/>: You really did scare me for a moment..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/17-newnatsuki7575.jpg"/>: I mean, if you really just left after all this, I would be super pissed."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Mitayo, I'm so happy...we can become an official club now! Thank you so much for this. You're really amazing. I'll do everything I can to give you a great time, okay?"<br/>
<br/>
<b>Can you promise me that no one will die? That waskind of a bummer last time.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-boyavatest.png"/>: Ah...thanks, I guess."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Okay, everyone! I think with that, we can officially end today's meeting on a good note. Everyone remember tonight's assignment: write a poem to bring to the next meeting, so we can all share!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Monika looks over at me once more. </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Mitayo, I look forward to seeing how you express yourself. Ehehe~"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-boyavatest.png"/>: Y-Yeah..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Can I really impress the class star Monika with my mediocre writing skills? I already feel the anxiety welling up inside me. Meanwhile, the girls continue to chit-chat as Yuri cleans up the tea set.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/10-boyavatest.png"/>: I guess I'll be on my way, then..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/12-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: Okay! I'll see you tomorrow, then. I can't wait!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>With that, I depart the clubroom and make my way home. The whole way, my mind wanders back and forth between the three girls: </i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/25-image012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/26-image013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/27-image014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Will I really be happy spending every day after school in a literature club? Perhaps I'll have the chance to grow closer to one of these girls...alright! I'll just need to make the most of my circumstances, and I'm sure good fortune will find me. And I guess that starts with writing a poem tonight... </i><br/>

<b>Well, this is new. At the end of each chapter, we unlock a special poem. There are quite a few of them in the game  more than there are actual scenes to view them in. Anything the game doesnt show us will be covered in a post-game update.</b><br/>

<b>Alright, boyos, <b><u>VOTE TIME.</u></b> Before you vote, there are three things to keep in mind:<br/>
<br/>
1)	There WILL be differences from last time regardless of what we choose  some of them more prominent than others.<br/>
<br/>
2)	We have not seen the resolution to Yuris path.<br/>
<br/>
3)	We will cover any scenes not picked within the LP after the endgame.<br/>
<br/>
With those caveats in mind  which group of poems would you like to go with? <u>Group A, Group B, or Group C</u>? Double votes for haikus. I realize that weve done haikus but theyre the only poems I like so if you dont like it dont write one, okay? <img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/emot-colbert.gif" title=":colbert:"/></b><br/>
