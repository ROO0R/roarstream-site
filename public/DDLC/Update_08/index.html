<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Walking home with Yuri, huh..."<br/>

<br/>
<b>This is the biggest point of all. Do you honestly think YURI would be so bold as to request we walk home with her? She gets nervous putting her on her shoes.</b><br/>

<br/>
<i>The conversation trails off, and I'm left feeling awkward. But it was kind of her fault for trapping me with such a weird question...I can't just lie to her. But if there's something that makes her happy, I would hate to take that away from her. That's why I said there's no point in speculating. But the festival is in just a few days...</i><br/>

<br/>
<i>I worriedly glance at Sayori before turning back toward everyone else. But the conversation has already dispersed, with everyone back at their usual activities. Maybe I should ask Monika if she's noticed anything about Sayori recently...since they've been preparing for the festival, they must be spending a lot of time together. I timidly approach Monika, who is shuffling through some papers at her desk.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Maybe I'm reading into it a little too much, but she seems a bit downcast today..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/9-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: "Oh? You think so? I can't say I've noticed anything about her..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Monika peers across the room at Sayori, who is idly dragging a rubber eraser up and down her desk.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>That, uh, is not like her at all.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/9-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: "Maybe there is something on her mind...but I'm surprised I'm not the one asking you, Mitayo. You certainly know her a lot better than I do."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Yeah, but she's never really like this...she's always talked to me about things that bothered her. But this time, when I asked her, she was really dismissive. Sorry, I know it's not your problem! I just wanted to ask if you knew anything, so I'll drop it now..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/9-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: "No, no...it's important to me, too. I mean, I'm also friends with her...and I also care about the well-being of my club members, you know? Maybe I'll try talking to her myself..."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Eh? Are you sure about that...? She seemed like she wanted to be left alone..."<br/>

<b>I admire that Monika just comes out and says what Sayori made perfectly clear with that 'walking home' question.</b><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Me...? How on Earth would you come to that conclusion?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/9-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: "Well...I probably shouldn't say too much, but...Sayori talks about you more than anything else, you know?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Eh...?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/9-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: "She's been so much happier ever since you've joined the club. It's like an extra light was turned on inside of her."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: What? No way...Sayori...is always like that. She's always been full of sunshine. It's not any different now than it always has been."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/9-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: "Ehehe. You're so funny, Mitayo. Have you thought that maybe you've always seen her as so cheerful...because that's just how she is when she's around you?"<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: ..."<br/>
<br/>
<b>This is much more obvious when following Sayori's path, but we've still seen plenty of hints throughout our run as well.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/9-newmonika7575.jpg"/>: "Ah...I said too much. I'm sorry...what do I know, anyway? I didn't mean to jump to conclusions, so you should just forget about what I said. I'll try to talk to her, so try not to think about it for now."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="assets/images/2-boyavatest.png"/>: Ah...alright..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>Monika smiles meaningfully. I know she said to forget about it...but I already know that I won't be able to get her words out of my head. Monika stands up from her desk and walks across the room to where Sayori is sitting. I watch her kneel down next to Sayori and gently talk to her. But she's keeping her voice so quiet that I can't hear her from here.<br/>
<br/>
I sigh and sit myself down. I know Sayori told me not to worry about her, and to have fun with everyone else...but that's impossible to do when she's behaving like this. Exactly how much do I care about her, that I'm letting this weigh me down so much? Now it feels like I'm the one behaving out of the ordinary...but there's nothing I can do besides wait for Monika.</i><br/>
<br/>
-----<br/>
<br/>
<i>Why does it feel like I'm being watched...? I glance around the room. Suddenly, I notice Yuri peering at me from over her book. But she looks away just as quickly with a flustered look on her face. I realize that she won't get anywhere like this. I've never really seen Yuri approach anyone or start a conversation on her own accord. So, I have no choice but to approach her myself. By now, it's a little easier for me to do that. I stand up from my desk and sit in one next to her own.</i><br/>

<div class="bbc-block"><h4>quote:</h4><blockquote> Ghost Under the Light pt. 2<br/>
<br/>
The tendrils of my hair illuminate beneath the amber glow.<br/>
Bathing.<br/>
In the distance, a blue-green light flickers.<br/>
A lone figure crosses its path - a silhouette obstructing the eerie glow.<br/>
My heart pounds. The silhouette grows. Closer. Closer.<br/>
I open my umbrella, casting a shadow to shield me from visibility.<br/>
But I am too late.<br/>
He steps into the streetlight. I gasp and drop my umbrella.<br/>
The light flickers. My heart pounds. He raises his arm.<br/>
<br/>
Time stops.<br/>
<br/>
The only indication of movement is the amber light flickering against his outstretched arm.<br/>
The flickering light is in rhythm with the pounding of my heart.<br/>
Teasing me for succumbing to this forbidden emotion.<br/>
Have you ever heard of a ghost feeling warmth before?<br/>
Giving up on understanding, I laugh.<br/>
Understanding is overrated.<br/>
I touch his hand. The flickering stops.<br/>
Ghosts are blue-green. My heart is amber.</blockquote></div>

<div class="bbc-block"><h4>quote:</h4><blockquote> The Lady who Knows Everything"<br/>
<br/>
An old tale tells of a lady who wanders Earth.<br/>
The Lady who Knows Everything.<br/>
A beautiful lady who has found every answer,<br/>
All meaning,<br/>
All purpose,<br/>
And all that was ever sought.<br/>
<br/>
And here I am,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
a feather<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lost adrift the sky, victim of the currents of the wind.<br/>
<br/>
Day after day, I search.<br/>
I search with little hope, knowing legends don't exist.<br/>
But when all else has failed me,<br/>
When all others have turned away,<br/>
The legend is all that remains - the last dim star glimmering in the twilit sky.<br/>
<br/>
Until one day, the wind ceases to blow.<br/>
I fall.<br/>
And I fall and fall, and fall even more.<br/>
Gentle as a feather.<br/>
A dry quill, expressionless.<br/>
<br/>
But a hand catches me between the thumb and forefinger.<br/>
The hand of a beautiful lady.<br/>
I look at her eyes and find no end to her gaze.<br/>
<br/>
The Lady who Knows Everything knows what I am thinking.<br/>
Before I can speak, she responds in a hollow voice.<br/>
"I have found every answer, all of which amount to nothing.<br/>
There is no meaning.<br/>
There is no purpose.<br/>
And we seek only the impossible.<br/>
I am not your legend.<br/>
Your legend does not exist."<br/>
<br/>
And with a breath, she blows me back afloat, and I pick up a gust of wind.</blockquote></div>

<b>Poem impressions: I like the structure of this poem and the way it plays across the page. Monikas right  it is visually appealing to play with the empty space.</b><br/>

Are you ever too shy to share your writing because you're afraid it's not that good? It can be really disheartening to get a lukewarm response to something you put so much into. But if you find other people who enjoy writing, then sharing becomes a lot easier! Because instead of just telling you that your writing is good, or okay, or bad...they'll want to focus more on everything that went into it, and the things you can work on. It's much more encouraging that way, and it will make you want to continue improving. It's almost like having your own little Literature Club, don't you think?"<br/>
